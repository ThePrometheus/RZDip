Before the debate, I asked local residents for comments about their recent experiences on Southern Rail. Unsurprisingly, in 24 hours over 100 people responded, sharing appalling stories about the chaos that is the Southern rail service. 

During the debate, I voiced rail passengers’ anger straight to the Transport Minister. Southern, Network Rail, the unions, and Ministers have all failed passengers. Action must be taken immediately to address these severe circumstances. We need short term mandatory mediation to end the union dispute and an emergency takeover of Southern with the end objective of devolving the running of suburban rail services to Transport for London.

It is appalling that Tory and DUP MPs cheered at the fact that, after years of pay restraint, our hard working police, firefighters, nurses and teachers continue to be deprived of the pay rises they deserve.

During the General Election campaign, I called for the cap to be lifted and for pay rises. Our local schools and NHS are already struggling with staff shortages. Living standards are falling as prices are rising. The Government failed to make the right decision. I believe that a better future is possible for our country.",

166841220058437_1233841410025074,"ARTICLE 50 : 

 the last few months, many people have contacted me about the referendum result, the triggering of Article 50 and our future relationship with the EU.
 
The vote to leave on the 23rd of June was an unprecedented decision for our country. I hope that this will clarify my position on what I believe to be the greatest challenge we have faced for at least fifty years.
 
First I should make it clear that I deeply regret the result and passionately believe that we are better off inside the EU, but I respect the outcome of the vote.
 
The path that we now face is uncertain. I am extremely concerned by the recent rise in hate crime and the inflammatory language used in the media and on social media that is sparking division in Britain.
 
I am also fearful of the impact of Brexit on people’s jobs, the economic stability of the country and the work, study and retirement opportunities made available to British citizens through our existing membership. It is too early to say how many of the economic fears about Brexit that were expressed during the campaign will become a reality, but the steep drop in the value of the £ has hurt many British companies which import parts from the EU.
 
Whilst the referendum campaign did give the public a voice on whether they would like to leave the EU or not, the Leave campaign gave no indication of what the new deal between the UK and the EU would look like.
 
Indeed, the Leave side did not produce a credible or unified position on what the UK would look like outside of the EU. For example, some Brexiters like Nigel Farage called for the UK to completely cut our ties with the EU, whilst others like Boris Johnson have said that we could remain in the Single Market. Because of this, I and Liberal Democrat colleagues welcomed the recent Supreme Court ruling which said that Parliament should have a vote on the triggering of Article 50, in line with the very principles of our parliamentary democracy. This case was not an attempt by MPs to block Brexit, as some have falsely claimed, but simply a successful attempt to confirm that no Government can scrap decisions taken previously by Parliament, without Parliament having their say.   
 
In her recent speech, Theresa May had the choice to pursue a form of Brexit that united our country, reflected the closeness of the vote and sought to heal divisions between Leave and Remain. Instead, she and the small elite around her, made the decision to go for the most destructive Brexit possible. She chose to ignore the numerous Leave voters who were sold the Norway and Swiss models meaning that we would stay in the single market. She chose to ignore 16.1 million people who wanted to stay in the EU. She chose to ignore young people, who have more of a stake in our country’s future, and voted 3 to 1 to remain.
\
She claimed people voted to leave the Single Market. There is no evidence of this. On the contrary, a recent poll has shown that 90% of people surveyed (both Remain and Leave voters) favour staying in the Single Market:https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/16/uk-voters-want-single-market-access-and-immigration-controls-poll-finds.  

As a Liberal Democrat, I will continue to make a strong case that this deal must include membership in the Single Market, and the Liberal Democrats will continue to advocate that we remain in this market.  The jobs of millions of British citizens could depend on it.

I also do not agree with the view that we should just remain silent during the negotiating process and accept any deal the Government comes up with. This issue is far too important to give the Government a blank cheque.  This is like saying that after a general election we should just accept and rubber stamp all decisions until the next election, without holding the Government to account.
 
The Prime Minister made clear that she will deny the people a vote on the final deal. So instead of a democratic decision by the people in the country, she wants a stitch-up by a small unrepresentative clique of politicians in Westminster.
 
I strongly believe that, just as people were able to vote for departure, they should be given a vote on the destination we are heading towards in our future relationship with the EU. If the process started with a vote of the people why shouldn’t it end with another one?
 
Liberal Democrats believe that people are sovereign and must have the opportunity to decide on the direction that the country takes. By providing a choice, the British public would be allowed to decide whether it is the right deal for them, their families, their jobs and our country. If you were a Brexit voter for example, would you settle for a deal that still meant paying into the EU budget? Wouldn’t you want a chance to have a vote if you disagreed with the Government’s deal?
 
That is why Liberal Democrats want a guarantee from the Government that there will be a public vote on the deal at the end of the negotiations, where people will be given the opportunity to vote for that deal or to remain in the EU.
 
Liberal Democrats will of course vote to trigger Article 50 if this popular guarantee is given.  The Government could simply say ‘Yes’ to the vote on the terms of the deal and the triggering of Article 50 would be delayed for no longer that the time it takes to say ‘‘Yes’’. 
 
Britain’s future in Europe will be the most important issue in our country for years to come. As your MP, I will continue to fight for an open, modern and inclusive Britain.","UK voters want single market access and immigration controls, poll finds"

This would be used to replace ‘clapped out hospitals and GP surgeries.’ I think that St Helier meets that criteria, and I will fight to ensure that St Helier Hospital receives some of some of the £350 million a week which is apparently going to be available to the NHS once the UK leaves the EU.

Great news.

Dear Sir/Madam
Between August and October 2015 we consulted on proposals to alter route 463 to run via Maldon Road, Montagu Gardens and Demesne Road. Thank you for your patience in waiting for our response.
We received 881 responses to the consultation. 869 responses were from members of the public and 12 were from stakeholders. 14 per cent of the responses supported or partially supported the proposals, 80 per cent said they did not support the proposals, 1 per cent were not sure, and 1 per cent did not express an opinion.
We have considered all of the responses and have decided not to proceed with the proposals to reroute the 463 via Maldon Road, Montagu Gardens and Demesne Road. The service will therefore continue to remain on its existing line of route. However, the school day only double deck journeys between Coulsdon South and Beddington Church will be renumbered as route 633 from April 2016.

The Early Day Motion sets out the Liberal Democrat view towards the Government’s handling of the junior doctors’ contracts. I have the utmost admiration for the passion, dedication and sense of vocation of junior doctors up and down the country and I believe the Government has handled the dispute poorly. There is value in reforming working practices if there is evidence that current arrangements are undermining the best possible patient care and the financial sustainability of the NHS, but the position the Government is taking does not achieve this. It is also essential that a renegotiated contract provides appropriate safeguards to protect junior doctors from excessive working hours, protects the pay of junior doctors who work regular weekend and evening shifts, and does not disadvantage those who take time out of full-time clinical work in order to undertake research or start a family. I am like many of my constituents concerned at the prospect of industrial action by tens of thousands of junior doctors who have been disillusioned with the management of the NHS by the Government and I desperately hope the Government will choose to enter into meaningful negotiations with junior doctors and the BMA. bit.ly/1LtJCM0",Timeline Photos

The Housing and Planning Bill being debated today however does nothing to tackle this national crisis. Worse than that, this Bill represents an assault on social and affordable housing when there are already 1.6 million people on social housing waiting lists.

The people who are hit hardest by this Bill are the most vulnerable and a rise in homelessness is inevitable. Furthermore, with fewer affordable homes there will be more people in expensive temporary accommodation which will drive up the Housing Benefit bill, meaning that this Bill is economically flawed as well.

I also challenged the Minister to explain why, when the level of human rights’ abuses around the world appears on the rise, Sir Simon McDonald, the top civil servant in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has said that human rights are no longer viewed as a top priority for the Government.

For people who are sick, disabled, students, raising a young family, struggling to find work , and children from poorer families, the future just got a lot bleaker.

These benefit cuts hit those on low pay with families hardest, go hand in hand with a cut in inheritance tax which benefits the wealthy. This boils down to taking from the poor and giving to the wealthy. Osborne claims to be balancing the books. The truth is he is robbing poor Peter to pay rich Paul.

Firstly, as shown by their involvement in the Scottish referendum, people below 18 care deeply about politics and the issues affecting their society. We should give them the chance to join in the national conversation.

Secondly, 16 and 17 year olds can already pay taxes, join the army, and get married. If they are deemed old enough to do all these things, then they are old enough to have a say in what happens in the society around them.

Finally, the issue of the EU Referendum will affect this age group for decades to come. In the spirit of democracy, we should therefore allow them to be heard on what may be a crucial component of their future.

Neither Labour nor the Tories have a credible response to the funding challenges that the NHS faces. Labour have pledged £2.5bn only to be fully introduced by the third year of the next parliament and have not committed to any additional real term increases beyond that, while the Conservatives have made no specific real terms funding commitments.
 
To achieve the increase in funding in the NHS by 2020/21, The Liberal Democrats will do three things:
 
The additional £1.7bn that the Liberal Democrats successfully secured in the Autumn Statement for 2015/16 will be maintained.
 
In addition to this funding, we will invest a further £1bn in real terms in 2016/17 (£250m of which we secured in this year's budget). This will be paid for by restricting reliefs on Capital Gains Tax and scrapping the Conservative 'shares for rights' scheme.

·         Guaranteeing 9m people a workplace pension, which their employers and the government pay in to, giving everyone the confidence to save. A new simple, single state pension to help people save for a better retirement.
·         The foundations for a new model of private pension— the defined ambition pension — where the risks and uncertainties are more evenly shared between employer and employee.
·         Abolished the default retirement age-making it illegal for people to be sacked simply because they became a pensioner.

- Issues with the new infrastructure’s reliability 
- Navigation issues for drivers with the new track and signaling
- Drivers being taken out of service to receive training on the new London Bridge layout. 
-Trespassers on the rail lines, fatalities, and incidents with passengers

Southern currently offers a delay repay scheme that can be found here: http://bit.ly/1CayF0U.

Like 38 degrees supporters, I am committed to an NHS which is free at the point of delivery and care that is based on clinical need, not ability to pay.
 
I am also committed to ensuring that the NHS is funded so that it can continue to deliver quality care up to 2020 and beyond.  That is why the Liberal Democrats have confirmed that a priority for us in the next parliament will be to provide the extra £8 billion per year for the NHS by 2020 that Simon Stevens, the Chief Executive of NHS England has stated is needed.
 
In response to 38 degrees petition, it is worth pointing out that in spite of the need to address the largest budget deficit in the industrialised world, the Coalition government has been able to maintain spending on the NHS and increase the numbers of Doctors (whilst cutting the number of managers).  The number of patients affected by MRSA or with beds in mixed wards is dropping.  And suggestions that the NHS is under threat from privatisation, aren’t supported by the facts; just six pence out of every pound spent on the NHS is spent with private companies and the very generous funding arrangements for private companies which applied under the previous Labour Government (which paid a premium to the private sector) have been scrapped.

Red Cross Scotland do fantastic work to help vulnerable people and it was a real privilege to meet some of the women they have helped.

155050791334658_779620152211049,"Edinburgh West MP Christine Jardine has called for women born in the 1950s and affected by state pension inequalities to bring her their stories to help the fight for a better deal.

The Lib Dem MP wants to build a dossier of evidence to present to the UK Government showing the hardship caused by the way the changes to pensionable were implemented.

Many women who expected to retire at 60 discovered the changes to pensionable age too late to make changes to their retirement plans to take into account the extra years they would have to wait.

Ms Jardine, who is one of the sponsors of a bill presented to Parliament by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Pension Inequality Suffered by women born in the 1950s, said:

“I want to make sure that we have as much evidence as possible of just how much hardship has been caused by the way these changes were made.

“It’s heartbreaking to hear what women who have worked all their lives and planned for their retirement have been put through simply because they weren’t warned about what was about to happen.

“Some, who had expected to have retired and getting their state pension by now, had to take on extra part time jobs just to get by or to stop eating into their savings.

“It’s simply unfair, and it’s up to the rest of us to make sure these women get the justice they deserve.

“The women who come to me say they accept we have to make changes to retirement ages but it’s the way that it was done that they object to.”

MP for Edinburgh West Christine Jardine has asked the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for an urgent meeting to discuss Edinburgh Airport’s latest proposals on flightpath changes, particularly effecting communities in South Queensferry and Cramond.  

The proposals, if approved, could see an increase in flights over South Queensferry and little change to current situation in Cramond where residents have complained about constant noise from arriving jets. 

 Ms Jardine, who has launched an Early Day Motion at Westminster, met with officials from Edinburgh Airport last week with Liberal Democrat colleagues, to discuss the issue, said:  

“This flight path proposals have caused enormous concern in communities across Edinburgh West. 

 “The airport is hugely important to Edinburgh for both jobs and improved infrastructure, however it is clear that there has been breakdown in communication leaving local communities feeling both ill-informed and disappointed about the current proposals. 

“Edinburgh airport has enjoyed a good relationship with surrounding communities in the past but these latest proposals are putting this relationship at risk.  

“I am seeking an urgent meeting with the CAA to discuss how any further damage can be avoided.  This is what communities in Edinburgh West deserve.”

Text of Ms Jardine's Early Day Motion 

Edinburgh Airport Flightpath 
That this House regrets that communities, especially Cramond and South Queensferry, in Edinburgh West are disappointed with the outcome of the consultation process over the new flights paths for Edinburgh Airport; asks Edinburgh Airport to strengthen communications with the towns and villages affected by the flightpath changes and calls on the Civil Aviation Authority to take into account residents’ concerns before any decision is made.",

It seems a long time since Theresa May called a snap General Election.

Now I sit opposite her on the green benches every Wednesday, bobbing up and down, trying to catch the speaker’s eye for a chance to question the Prime Minister herself.
That weekly appointment may be the most high profile public event in my diary but, for me, it’s just one of the many opportunities I now have to represent the people of Edinburgh West and the concerns that you bring to me.
Since June 9 my week has been divided - every Monday to Thursday has been spent in Westminster, and then home to hold advice surgeries and catch up on the many issues you have brought to the office.

For me that is the core of the job: being here to respond to your concerns, meet the community councils and work with our other elected representatives in Edinburgh West.

And there are the daily calls from people who need our help with pensions, benefits, immigration, airport noise, environmental concerns and many other areas.

We’ve also been able to meet local employers and companies and raise issues with organisations like Edinburgh Airport, BT and the Scottish Government.

But in Westminster is the opportunity to press for the change on both those general and individual issues.

In just a few weeks I’ve been able to raise the RBS jobs cuts in the House of Commons, then have a chance to speak to the bank themselves to get reassurances about jobs in Edinburgh West.

I responded to the concerns many of you raised about pension inequalities for the WASPI women born in the 1950s by joining the All Party Parliamentary Group on the issue, and signing a proposed Bill to review the legislation.

And I was able to ask the Health Minister, in a debate, to ensure that the forthcoming inquiry on contaminated blood transfusions which affected so many people across Scotland, will have the right powers to enable it to call the witnesses and obtain the documents the victims and their families need to get justice.

Perhaps the most important thing I’ve discovered so far, however, is that amidst the pomp and circumstance of the Palace of Westminster are many ordinary people, like me, committed to doing their best for the people who elected them.

Over the summer I will be home in Edinburgh West talking to as many of those people as I can, with the team I have set up to work for you.

In my maiden speech in the House of Commons I promised to send my time as your MP working with my team to focus on the issues that you are concerned about.
If you have anything you want to raise with us please drop in to our temporary base at 183 St John’s road or our new office at 125 St John’s Road from later this summer.

I hope to see you there.

“Scottish Liberal Democrats have argued all along that Theresa May will never be able to get a deal for Britain outside the EU as good as the one we have now.

Edinburgh West MP Christine Jardine has called on Nicola Sturgeon to ‘do the decent thing’ and give the communities in the shadow of the Queensferry crossing access to its official opening.

There’s growing public anger over the SNP Government’s failure to throw open the event to the communities, opting instead for a ballot open to all on a website with only a limited number of tickets for select groups. MSP for Edinburgh Western Alex Cole-Hamilton has also pressed the First Minister to release tickets to residents.

Ms Jardine criticised the Government's move saying: 

“This looks like little more than a publicly funded publicity stunt.

“The opening was the SNP’s chance to thank our communities for the disruption they have endured and will continue to endure because of the bridge building, road works and housing developments.

“Instead they have chosen to ignore that and use the opening as a blatant attempt to bolster their own sagging prestige.

“There is still time for them to do the decent thing and recognise the contribution of local communities.”",

There, between two tricolour, was the flag of the EU.
Almost for the first time I noticed how beautiful it is. 
Not just because of the simplicity of the bright gold stars on the luxurious blue background.
Because of what it took to make it happen.
What it means to people across Europe.
It is - regardless of the myths peddled by Leave - a democratic institution straddling a continent which, within living memory, was torn apart by war, fascism and communist dictatorship.
Its an achievement we should cherish.
In this country in the 20th Century we were only too familiar with the horrendous hardships of war.
But we did not suffer defeat, occupation or the yolk of Soviet, or fascist, oppression.
Imagine what it must mean to the people of Romania or Poland to have found sanctuary in an organisation which protects their democracy and allows it to flourish.
Or the pride in Spain and Greece at being recognised as modern democracies by those who previously opposed their form of government.
Too often the discussion here focusses on trivial tabloid tales of straight bananas and low voltage toasters.
Or worse, on overblown immigration figures designed to create fear and tension.
Too often we overlook the employment rights, the trading power, the financial support.
The Peace.
Looking at that flag yesterday I was struck by overwhelming pride in what the people of Europe have achieved.
Tomorrow I will vote Remain.I will vote to keep us at the centre of the EU.
I will vote to keep that flag.",

I was proud of the fact that I introduced the cap when I was minister. It would have made such a difference to people’s lives, allowing them to plan for old age with the knowledge that they would be protected if they needed social care for conditions like dementia.

We are expecting very high tides this weekend, and I wanted to pass on the below update from the Environment Agency:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Dear Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk MPs

You may have heard that this weekend we are expecting the highest tides for 19 years.  I am writing to let you know that we are monitoring weather and tidal forecasts, and we are not expecting there to be an accompanying surge. Although tide heights will be high, we do not expect any more than minimal flooding at a few coastal locations which is typical at this time of year.

Early indications are that we will be issuing a couple of Flood Alerts on Friday, approximately 12 Flood Alerts on Saturday, and possibly a couple of Flood Warnings on Saturday for Wells-next-the-Sea and Harwich.

We do not anticipate properties, farmland or roads to be impacted by flooding.

Our staff will be manning our tidal barriers (Ipswich, Colne and Thameside) over the high tide periods on Friday and Saturday, and closing them if necessary.

Please advise any concerned constituents to check their local flood risk on our website www.gov.uk/floodsdestroy over the coming days. People can also sign up for free flood warnings either on our website or by calling Floodline on 0845 988 1188.

If you have any questions please feel free to get in touch with me on the number below. 

With best wishes

There has been huge interest locally in proposals for a new Wetherspoons at the current Town Council offices here in North Walsham.

I have seen from your comments on this issue is that there is real support for the idea of a Wetherspoons in the town. But I also recognise the importance for the Town of finding a suitable new home for our Citizens’ Advice Bureau and the Community Transport Service, both of which currently use the offices, and for the Town Council itself. Many people in the town rely on these services.

The Town Council offices were purchased by North Walsham District Council in the 50s, paid for by local council tax payers, and North Walsham District Council continued to own the building until a restructuring of Norfolk’s councils in 1974. It is absolutely right that the proceeds of the sale should stay in the town. But North Norfolk District Council has refused to say that the proceeds from the sale of the building will be kept by North Walsham.

The Town Council is taking legal advice on its rights over the building - but I want to work with local councillors to make sure that this doesn’t degenerate into a costly legal dispute. I also want to make sure that we don’t lose this opportunity for valuable new investment in the town by failing to agree about the future of the building.

I have asked North Norfolk District Council to attend a summit meeting I will chair, together with the Town Council, to end this stalemate once and for all. Do you agree? Sign the petition here!",Support our summit meeting to end Wetherspoons stalemate

Managing-Bipolar is a not for profit Eastbourne organisation struggling to get funding with the continued austerity measures. And they’ve contacted me to ask if I and my fb friends could step up for them, which I am very happy to do.

They’re bidding for an application to the Aviva Community Fund but to have any chance of winning against stiff competition, they need our vote!

The application shows Brighton but it’s funding, if they win it, will be used to ensure their group locally, in Eastbourne can grow from strength to strength. 

And the voting starts today (24th Oct) at 9 o’clock and ends at noon on 21 November 2017.

To find out about the project and to vote, please go to this link: 

https://community-fund.aviva.co.uk/voting/project/view/17-2655

 Anybody in the UK can vote and they get 10 votes each which can all be used on the same project. Judging by last year’s voting, they need to get at least 27,000+ to stand a chance of winning. 

Please use all 10 votes if you can for the Managing Bi-polar Group so they’re in with a chance, and also spread the word by sharing this link to everybody you know. Thx.

I’m told the competition will be greater than last year where there were nearly 4,000 applications for the  only 8 awards in the category they’ve applied for, which is ‘Inclusivity’.

You’ll remember I posted about the organisation a few weeks ago. A group of local people with bi-polar who support each other and welcome new members with the condition. Like a lot of mental health problems, bi-polar can be frighteningly isolating so having an experienced peer group in Eastbourne and beyond which meet regularly to share ideas and to support each other is a real plus.

What we need here is progress... so I've been working on a constructive plan which I will put forward in today's debate.

Meanwhile first thing this morning I had a practical discussion with RMT's General Secretary Mick Cash. I am convinced the best way forward is to get 'all' sides talking together to resolve the dispute. 

We understand locally more than most that it simply cannot keep dragging on. It's proving very damaging to our town both economically and from a basic morale perspective. 

And chucking bricks at each other is not productive - time to negotiate with all Party's and all cards on the table - at the same time!

Next Saturday the 27th May at 2pm the Eastbourne Sunshine Carnival will be setting off in its procession from the Western Lawns to Princes Park for the sixth year running. And this year's theme is Our Community - Our World.

As the Patron of our fantastic carnival I'm delighted that this years event will be our biggest yet. With over 60 floats, walking processions, musical bands and vintage vehicles taking part with around 2,000 participants, we've put together a really great show for you all. 

So do make a note in your diary now please, and remember our earlier start time this year of 2pm. 

Bring the family, your friends, your work colleagues, anyone you can think of to ensure we have our biggest crowd yet for 2017.

As well as our earlier start this year, we have also introduced a number of fixed entertainment spots which will be getting the crowds into the carnival-mood from 1pm. These will be at the RNLI Museum turnoff, the Bandstand, the Pier, corner by the Langham Hotel, slopes down from the Redoubt and near the Fisherman's Club. All are fantastic acts, all there to entertain you, and I am thrilled to introduce these innovations. My objective was to always keep growing Carnival, making it better and better so that it becomes, once again, a must-see fixture in our town's events calendar.

Another innovation for 2017 is to welcome the Towner Gallery. They're education out-reach programmes have been running a series of carnival-art workshops with schools across Eastbourne and beyond, and ten of them have entered as part of their unique walking procession. I've seen a sample of what the kids have designed and put together and it's just brilliant. Look out for them on the day. You won't miss it - their section is 300 people strong!

And folks, please don't forget to put as much money as you can in the collection buckets. Remember half goes to all the charities taking part and the other half goes into our Carnival bank account for next year. This keeps the event financially sustainable which was always my original plan. 

I'd also like to thank the Arndale Centre for sponsoring us again, and all my carnival team of volunteers who give up so much of their time through the year to make it such a success. Thx all. I really am terribly grateful.

I've just got a tip that apparently the Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling is in Eastbourne. This is the same man who has presided over the shambolic government response to the Southern Rail dispute over the last year or so. Suddenly, after ignoring Eastbourne throughout the whole process, he pays us a visit. Suddenly our Tory MP who has been mouthing government platitudes about the dispute for months now whilst singularly failing to secure a visit from Grayling to meet with our hard-pressed commuters and businesses, we get a visit!!

I wonder if there's an election on and Tory HQ  are beginning to panic that they are about to lose this seat on June 8th?

If their electioneering wasn't so laughably transparent one could almost weep with frustration. Shades of Cameron's surprise visit at the time of the Pier fire.....

Our town has suffered terribly whilst this whole longstanding dispute has dragged on, and all the government and Grayling have done is either say - ""nothing to do with us guv"" or ""it's all them unions fault"" rather than actually step up, show some leadership and bring ALL the parties around the negotiating table with no pre-conditions immediately. 

So I'm pinging this out to you my fb friends. If you see The Secretary of State for Transport around Eastbourne today tell him to get ready for the first Transport questions that I'm going to attend, god willing, as your MP in a few weeks time. Where I am going to aim a metaphorical bazooka at this man and challenge him to stop wittering on and actually sort the dispute before Eastbourne and the whole South East go into recession, because of his government's inept handing of the dispute. 

So folks. To help you in your search across town, I've pasted two photos of him below. One as himself and the other looking unerringly like Frank Spencer!!

And for my younger fb followers who don't know who that is - check out Frank Spencer references on google.

1632026600406302_1929052690703690,"Remember our shocking Pier fire?

I'm sure you all remember the dreadful experience the whole town went through when our beloved Pier caught fire. I was sitting in my office at the time just up the road and still recollect, as if it was yesterday, rushing out to see what on earth was going on. 

As we know the Blue Room was gutted and for a time it was touch and go the conflagration may spread to the rest of the Pier. Thank heaven the quick work by our firefighters, the Eastbourne RNLI Lifeboat and Coast Guard meant the core structure was saved. 

I know I speak for the whole town when I give thanks to all of them to this day!

The reason I'm flagging the memory though is that only last week I visited two wonderful local artists Hannah and Jon Hammond who specialise in wood carvings and artwork. I first met them shortly after the fire when they approached me about obtaining some of the burnt wood from the Pier. Their idea was to use it in their carvings as a way of preserving our Eastbourne Heritage for years to come in people's homes locally and perhaps, even, around the world. A bit of Eastbourne across the globe!

I thought this was a brilliant idea so helped them get access to the charred wood, and the rest of the story really should be theirs:

""Not long after the fire that devastated the Blue Room on Eastbourne Pier in the summer of 2014, we got in touch with Stephen Lloyd - our MP at the time - to ask if he would help us salvage whatever wood had survived. We wanted to do something for the town that would commemorate the last piece of the original Victorian Pier that had been lost to the fire, and keep the history alive for generations to come. Stephen was passionate about this idea, and immediately agreed to help us. He got in touch with those running the clean up operation, and before we knew it Jon was in a hard hat and high-vis jacket, walking between the blackened joists, collecting the remains of the decking. 

After almost three years of work, the decking we reclaimed that day now exists as bowls, art pieces, and jewelry in the homes of hundreds of people all around the world, some as as far-flung as Tanzania, Canada, and Australia! Thanks to Stephen's dedication to the town and its local businesses, we are now going strong as Hammond & Hammond - the husband and wife artist team who work exclusively in reclaimed woods. Our mission is to preserve local history, and it's through Stephen's endless devotion to his town that the important cultural heritage of Eastbourne can be treasured timelessly within our art.

Thank you Stephen for all the work you do in the local community, past, present, and future.""

In his own words:

""During 2016 myself and 11 others (mainly from the SAHA Foyer in Newhaven) participated in the Odyssey Invictus personal development programme ( http://www.odysseygrp.co.uk/educational-safaris/odyssey-invictus/) that includes an expedition to KwaZulu Natal in South Africa. One aspect of the expedition was our visiting a deprived school (Ntokozo) to donate learning resources and gain an understanding of what it is like to live and be educated in rural South Africa. 

We were all shocked by the appalling quality of facilities and resources available to the children. Despite this they are totally committed to learning and building positive and rewarding lives for themselves.

The reason for my approaching you is that following the visit our Invictus group are totally committed to doing whatever we can to help with the development of the school and support the children’s education. Sadly, the resources they need are not available from local funds and our ambition is to make a difference, no matter how large or small, in helping them.

I am holding a hair cutting event where I'll be having my hair completly shaven off to raise money for Ntokozo school.
All the money will go toward Ntokozo and the hair that is cut wll be donated to the little princess trust.""

Michael gave me permission to say that he'd faced some challenges of his own at school in Eastbourne but this trip and his involvement with Odyssey Invictus, really helped turn his life around. Well done Mike. To coin a phrase my dear old mum used to say - 'we help ourselves by helping others.'

Last Tuesday evening (18/4) I posted that I was re-standing as your MP in the upcoming snap general election on June 8th, and that I needed your help to win. 

The response has been nothing short of miraculous. So far 368 people have signed up to help my grassroots campaign, and an astonishing 452 of you have donated.

Thank you my friends. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Truly, it is no wonder I love this town.....

It was an enormous privilege for me to serve you once before as your MP and if I am given the honour of being re-elected, I promise to work just as hard on your and the town's behalf as I did before. It's what I do and it's what Eastbourne deserves from their MP.

Now of course the Tories will always have gazillions of pounds from their multi millionaire donors but your generosity has helped level the playing field here. 

I told you my target was £20,000 and that I had only £984 in our campaigns account when the snap election was called. So I asked for your help - and within a few days the figure was over £10,000!! And we are now only £6,400 short.

Can you help me smash our £20,000 target today?

I always planned to run a truly grassroots campaign. Serving Eastbourne is what I believe in. It's why I do what I do and it's why I am re-standing.

I had the pleasure of meeting local lad Mikey Young only last week. He told me of his epic fundraising effort to raise money for the British Lung Foundation: to run 12 marathon distances in only 6 days. An amazing feat and I wish him all the very, very best.

He starts from Penzance today and will end at our Pier, 8pm Wednesday evening. See his extraordinary schedule below:

Friday 21st April - Penzance to Bodmin 49miles
Saturday 22nd April - Bodmin to Exeter 60miles
Sunday 23rd April - Exeter to Dorchester 55miles
Monday 24th April - Dorchester to Ferndown, Bournemouth 28miles (almost a day off!!)
Tuesday 25th April Ferndown, Bournemouth to Chichester 55miles
Wednesday 26th April Chichester to Eastbourne (8pm finish) 52miles

What is even more astonishing and the reason Mikey is running to raise money for the British Lung Foundation is he has a genetic condition which severely restricts his own lung capacity. And sadly his father died only a few years ago from the condition.

Mikey is a true Eastbourne stalwart, went to school at what was then Hampden Park, works as a chef at one of our excellent local Care Homes, Rivendale Lodge, and is being supported by Tempo for his gear (hi Wes & Fay - it was a pleasure to open your then new business a few years ago in Susan's Road). And also Club Class Chauffeurs who drove him all the way to Penzance yesterday for no charge.

A good man supported by our wonderful Eastbourne community - all for an important cause which affects many people adversely across the UK.

According to recent media coverage a report due to be published imminently is expected to criticise the £1 billion a year contract handed to the company GTR (Govia Thameslink Railway) by the government, which has left the taxpayer with huge bills for lost fares and passenger compensation. 

GTR's generous seven year franchise was originally signed off by Patrick McLoughlin - the former Tory Chief Whip in parliament, when he was Secretary of State for Transport. 

It's a strange deal to put it mildly!?

A special type of management contract which bizarrely ensures it's the taxpayer who bears the main financial risk, such as the £38m bill for loss of revenue caused by strikes on Southern last year and the millions more paid in compensation. 

McLoughlin and his team had somehow came up with a deal which ensures we the taxpayer pay for the strikes and the passenger compensation - not Southern Rail....!

Plus the taxpayer coughs up to Southern/GTR if there are delays on the service due to the Thameslink upgrade and London Bridge development. And with a quarter of the network's trains (carrying 30,000 passengers a day) being late over the last year, double the national average, that's a lot of money.

Think about this; when your train is late and Southern pay you compensation - they're effectively paying you from your own bank account.....

Truly. Some things you just can't make up.

Meanwhile the strikes rumble on and the government pretends they've no responsibility and it's 'solely down to the company and the trade unions.'

Which of course is complete rubbish. All it would take to get everyone around the negotiating table with no pre-conditions and the sides ready to compromise, so long suffering commuters from Eastbourne and across the South East can have their lives back, is for the current Tory Secretary of State Chris Grayling to pick up the phone, call them and instruct they do so today. But of course he doesn't actually want a no pre-conditions, compromise negotiation with 'both' the Unions at the same time. I wonder why? 

But until Grayling actually does step up, I believe he is just as culpable as his predecessor Sir Patrick McLoughlin was in giving GTR such an absurd management contract in the first place.......

In an unprecedented move Eastbourne and Willingdon Heads have recently written to parents asking they contact their MP to say how concerned they are at the cuts to school budgets under the government's new funding formula. 

In all my years in politics I have never known school Heads come out publicly en masse against funding proposals. Ever! 

And why is this?

Bluntly - because the proposals, if they go through, will cause serious problems for many of our schools; severe reductions in per pupil funding which will lead to fewer teachers to manage growing class sizes. A scenario we simply have to stop.

To give you an idea of the scale of the cuts and why the Heads have stepped up publicly, I've listed below three schools of different sizes and age-ranges from across the constituency, and the impact: 

St Andrews Infants C of E School:
IMPACT
-£64,180 Budget change by 2019 
-214 Per pupil 
-2 Teachers 

Ocklynge Junior School:
IMPACT
-£103,635  Budget change by 2019
-124 Per pupil
-3 Teachers 

Willingdon Community School:
IMPACT
-£468,584 Budget change by 2019

-£12 Teachers 

These are absolutely shocking figures. Click on the site below if you want to see how your own children's school is affected.

I would urge all my FB friends to email the MP to demand that she step up for the town's children and forces the government to reconsider their proposals. It is a Tory government and it is her party - but her first duty must always be Eastbourne & Willingdon in my view.

I am concerned though that the MP simply does not appreciate why our Heads are so anxious.

During a recent debate (20th March) in Westminster she bizarrely said: ""I am the only Member of Parliament in England who can say that every school in their constituency will either hold steady or see a (funding) rise.""

When virtually all our schools will be absolutely hammered by the  cuts I am staggered at the MP's absurd lack of knowledge of her own town.

I would just like to thank the many people who have already responded to my post below which I put up on Tuesday, re the SavetheDGH campaign group trying to get more accurate data on births during transfers from the DGH. The response has been fantastic. Clearly a lot of mums have had some utterly dreadful experiences which makes it doubly important we collect this information in our ongoing battle to return consultant led maternity services to our hospital. Thank you.

I've re-posted below in case anyone has missed it and would like to confidentially send me their transfer experience. 

--------
Dear All - we had one of our regular SavetheDGH campaign meetings last Saturday and amongst other things, we discussed the three recent births in cars or ambulances on the road to the Conquest Hospital in Hastings. And how terribly frightening each of these must have been for the mums and dads involved. 

Which frankly is why we as a cross-community campaign group still remain so resolute in our determination to bring consultant-led maternity back to the DGH!

However the reason I'm flagging these births is it's proved hugely difficult for us to get a fix on exactly how many similar incidents have happened over the last few years. And I include births that 'just in time' were delivered at the Conquest or elsewhere but could have had to take place on the roadside. Either on the road to Hastings or Brighton.

So I'm asking you, my FB friends, for help in collecting this important data?

If you have been through it yourself or know someone who has, please private message me with brief details and the approximate date - or email the info to me at: stephen@stephenlloyd.org.uk 

I will treat anything sent to me with my usual confidentiality unless you agree otherwise. 

With 1,800 births a year in the past being the norm from our DGH now reduced to around only 350 at the (excellent) midwife-led maternity unit, it's a hell of of lot of Eastbourne (or beyond) parents having to make an absolutely rotten journey to the Conquest to give birth. And don't even get me started on the dreadful public transport links between the two hospitals!

The SavetheDGH Campaign Team are concerned that we may not be hearing of as many traumatic births on route from the DGH as there actually are. 

Hence my ask; please feel free to like and share this post as widely as possible so I can collate all the info that is out there from in and around our town.

Many thanks folks, as ever.",

I had the pleasure a few weeks ago to meet the Founder of a local company called Eastbourne Beauty Training. Her name was Charlotte Bracken and she's been running her business for a few years now in North Harbour. 

I've been in business myself long enough to know that whilst the beauty industry has tremendous potential it is also very competitive, so I was interested to know what Charlotte thought was her main USP (unique selling point). 

What she had to say was important and went some way to explaining why the company was recently shortlisted for a major industry award so I've pasted it below:
 
""I train and support mature students looking for a career change, perhaps they have been out of the workplace for some time due to raising a family etc.""
 
""All the courses are offered 1:1 so that my learners are fully supported and have the time for hands-on practical application.  And the maximum number of students is 2-4 depending on the course. The theory is studied in the students own time at home to allow for flexibility and takes away the stress of a classroom environment if they haven’t studied for some years.""

Well I like the idea of practical courses which help people get back into the market as jobs was always one of my key drivers as your MP. And Charlotte is clearly passionate about her company and what it offers. 

Good luck to her - enterprise can and should be open to all and I have met numerous Eastbourne mums over the years who want to get into a business which allows them to work from home whilst looking after the kids, and it's obvious Charlotte has helped many achieve that goal successfully. Well done, and good luck with the future growth of your company. 

Folks. If you want to contact Charlotte for details her personal email is: charlotte-bracken@hotmail.co.uk

And finally - Happy Mothers Day to all those mums out there who are my FB friends. I hope you are being well and truly looked after today because you deserve it - and that's a fact!!!",Photos from Stephen Lloyd MP's post

Like many of you I've watched appalled at the full horror of the terrorist attack which took place yesterday in Westminster. 

A powerful statement from the Prime Minister soon afterwards reminding us of how we must work together to protect the democratic values we cherish against the nihilistic barbarism of those who try to do our Nation harm. 

My thoughts and prayers go to the victims of this despicable attack, and their families. 

My admiration goes to our security services who stepped up immediately to protect the public, and for the police officer, Keith Palmer, who has so sadly lost his life in the defence of parliament and those who work there.

1632026600406302_1902839253325034,"'Government criticised over plans to spend £20million taking children to nearest grammar school by taxi, whilst cutting funds for disabled, general school student transport.'

I'm absolutely staggered to read that the DfE (Dept of Education) are to get extra money from the Chancellor to pay for taxis for pupils attending the new grammar schools proposed by the government, whilst cuts will be made to pupil transport for disabled and disadvantaged children to our general schools.

Apparently the new funding is for grammar school pupils to be ferried by taxi at a cost of up to £5,000 per student each year. All whilst cutting money to local councils for providing transport for disabled children to our mainstream and special schools, by £7m pa from 2016-17. 

Many of you will remember the local campaign I've highlighted on my FB in support of young Billy and his mum Leanna Forse, who because she was refused transport funding has had to give up her job as a teacher so she can take Billy to college herself. A dreadful episode which a number of us, with Leanna's support, are still trying to explore a possible legal challenge.

So to read this announcement by the DfE is just appalling. What they're effectively saying is we'll cut the funding for disabled and disadvantaged children's transport to the vast majority of schools, but increase it substantially for those pupils chosen to attend a new selective grammar school.

No ifs or buts - this is an absolutely disgraceful decision by the Conservative government.

They should be ashamed of themselves - and we must hold every single Tory MP in the country to account over such an unfair decision.

Please sign my petition below, contact your local Conservative member of parliament to say you have signed - and demand they lobby their colleague Secretary State for Education Justine Greening MP, to reverse this shockingly divisive proposal.

And insist the DfE give the money back to where it rightly belongs and where it has been cut - the Transportj fund for 'all' our affected children and not just the grammar school few.

Sign below and share please. This is a bad business and mustn't go unchallenged.

Detailed planning is taking place to welcome our brilliant Sunshine Carnival back again for its sixth year on Bank Holiday, Saturday 27th May. 

We're all working hard on the Committee to ensure Eastbourne has another great Carnival this year. It was always one of my objectives when I was your MP to bring back Carnival after a fifteen year gap, so it's a huge pleasure to see it has become a regular fixture again in the town's packed events agenda. 

We've an earlier start time this year of 2pm, so it will be easier for parents with young children to enter or bring them along for the fun. 

The route will follow our regular pattern; from the Western Lawns start to Princes Park end, and the Fairground will also be in Princes Pk to greet the end of the procession.

As flagged earlier our theme: 'Our Community - Our World' fits perfectly I think with Eastbourne's deep sense of community. And with some of the turbulent challenges the world is facing, linking a local community theme to a wider perspective reminds us that there is often much more which binds than separates, wherever or whoever we are.

We are always very keen to keep making Eastbourne's Carnival bigger and better so a new innovation for 2017 is we'll be adding a number of static entertainment spots along the route. Bands will be keeping everyone in the mood as they wait for the main procession. I'm looking forward to these and think they'll soon become a regular feature.

It's going to be another tremendous event, so please don't forget to make a note in your diaries now. And if you want to enter a float or walking procession yourselves, details can be found on our website: http://www.eastbournecarnival.co.uk

Glad to hear the Chancellor has reversed his position after breaking a promise in the Tory general election manifesto NOT to raise NIC. Perhaps he will now U-turn on the government's rejection of our demand for a dual carriageway on the A27 between Eastbourne and Lewes? 

And I can even tell him where to find the money:- use the £250m that's suddenly become available as the Department of Transport have cancelled the proposed Chichester by-pass......
 
The Chancellor bowed to the inevitable over his NIC 'foot-in-mouth' error in the Budget but his government is still only looking at tinkering with our section of the A27 which is simply not good enough. It's a shocking road, both unsafe and inappropriate for a major seaside town like Eastbourne in the 21st century. 

So I am asking the government to do the right thing for our town - give us a dual carriageway - and to do it now.

1632026600406302_1899070210368605,"Only Transport Minister Chris Grayling  and his Tory colleagues can break the logjam over the rail strikes:

As many long suffering passengers from Eastbourne and the South East will be only too aware, Monday was the RMT's 30th strike day in its dispute with Southern Rail over the company's plans to introduce driver-only-operated trains (DOO).

This dispute has now spread north and guards and drivers working for Merseyrail and Northern also took action over similar DOO proposals.

RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the union's position on DOO was ""perfectly clear"" and added it would ""not agree to any introduction of DOO"".

Meanwhile, every day there is strike action Eastbourne and other towns suffer. Businesses lose money, commuters put their jobs at risk as they miss appointments or can't get into work, local residents fail to make important dates in London, sometimes life-threatening appointments as we heard recently with a local lad who regularly needs to visit a hospital in London to get specialist kidney treatment, and not forgetting the strike days affect our own students ability to get to Brighton, Lewes etc for their studies. All these are severely impacted by the 'non' rail service.

So what's going on?

In short, the government is trying to cut its rail costs by getting shot of guards on trains. 

Ignore whatever other spin they or the train operators are putting on this; that's exactly what they're trying to do.

Now I happen to think it's a bad idea and not just because of the safety reasons the Unions lead on, but because I have lost count of the number of women who have contacted me in Eastbourne (and beyond) to say they would not feel safe travelling to and fro from London/Eastbourne at night if they knew there was no second member staff on board. This is simply unacceptable in the 21st century as it would effectively, over time, discourage half our population from getting full access to what we rightly take for granted. Equal access! 

And on that score from a disability perspective, for some disabled people no guard would also equal no access at all, which is totally wrong.

So my view is that as we already pay through the nose for what is effectively one of the most expensive rail services in the world, I think it's perfectly reasonable for passengers to be sure, particularly on longer trips, that there is a second member of staff on board to go to if there are any problems. Heck - keep them busy by all means, have them walk up and down checking tickets and even, perish the thought, get them doing what most other co's do nowadays; provide a little customer care by smiling and saying hello to their passengers. I suspect both parties would feel better for that.

And finally - the blunt truth is the government cannot win this fight. 

That's the thing that's most frustrating. They've deliberately gone into a battle - without the tools to win! I find this both astonishing and incredibly dim.

The RMT won't/can't give in because, rightly or wrongly, they know very well that if they lose their 35,000 strong union will be eviscerated and down to 5,000 in a few years; why they've dug in so hard. And that's not me necessarily supporting their position it's just stating the bleeding obvious! It's the sort of basic strategic overview which someone in this government and the Dft should have thought of before they started their whole DOO campaign. 

And they didn't.

Stupid or what?

And the situation is now beyond parody. Our town is getting killed over this; I've had it with both sides and I've particularly had it with the government's ill thought-out idealogical agenda which has got us into this mess. 

So what can we do?

In short - we need to put the fear of God into every Tory MP in the South East by making it crystal clear that they MUST go to Secretary of State Chris Grayling right now and tell him to call it a day. Tell him to pick the phone up to the train operators and the unions and say ""everyone around the table now, with no pre-conditions and I want a compromise by the end of the week"" 

A deal was done on Scotrail so a deal can be done here. 

And Grayling WILL listen to the MP's because with such a small gov majority, if enough of them threaten to resign over this he'll pick up the phone before they've even left his office. 

If that means stopping the introduction of DOO, well I'm fine with that for reasons I've flagged above. And if it also means a loss of face for the government - well, they shouldn't have started a fight they hadn't properly thought through.

So my message to all our local Tory MPs? Do your job and stick up for your constituents rather than just parroting the gov line.  Call the Secretary of State and do it today.

Please sign and share my petition far and wide folks. Help me ramp up the pressure. It's time to end this nonsense......

As many of you will know the government are already bringing in a number of proposals from April this year which I totally disagree with. The one I've written most about is the 30% cut in income for those disabled people who are trying to find work and will be in the Work Related Group of ESA.

I still find it incredible how any Tory MP can honestly believe the best way to encourage someone with a disability into a job is to slash their money by 30% a week!!

I've recently been contacted by a local resident who told me of another, frankly shameful cut, that is also happening in a months time.

Apparently there are changes to benefit payments for people who suffer bereavement at a young age - where one of the parents die - which could see the family lose out by over £12,000 in entitlements.

Research by the Childhood Bereavement Network says 91% of bereaved parents will be supported for a shorter period of time than under the current system. They said ""We are really worried about these changes and fear for the stress this will place on parents trying to support their grieving children.” They fear that this additional strain on families will have a significant negative impact on children’s lives, resulting in worse mental health and educational outcomes.

A bad business this. Very bad.

Meanwhile, we heard yesterday that the Chancellor is also going to give another £320m to expand Free and Grammar schools. This in addition to a Free School budget that is already predicted to exceed an astonishing £9bn whilst they are 'significantly' cutting funding per pupil at 'all' our other schools. 

The situation has become so difficult I am aware our local schools have taken the unprecedented step of urging parents to write to the MP so that she can lobby her government to stop the cuts, which are affecting the vast bulk of her constituents children. I do hope she steps up!?

Make no mistake - the three examples I've flagged above show who this government considers important - and who it doesn't.

I was profoundly disappointed to read over the weekend that Theresa Mays senior policy advisor, George Freeman MP, was quoted as saying that PIP payments should only go to people with ""real"" disabilities rather than ""people taking pills for anxiety"". 

For those of my FB friends who don't know, PIP is an acronym for Personal Independence Payments, which is a benefit to assist people with disabilities in the additional costs they incur because of their impairment. 

Freeman was quoted as saying: ""We want to get the money to the really disabled people who need it.""

This is a shockingly cruel and ignorant statement. Some examples of the disabilities his woeful all-encompassing statement would exclude from PIP are?

Dementia, schizophrenia, autism, Learning Disability or even cognitive disorder after a major stroke.

Our Community library has been run for and by Old Town residents for well over ten years now and it was a great opportunity for us to not only raise much needed cash, but to tell the shoppers about us as well. We were also giving away to the children some lovely hand made Old Town Library book-marks which went down really well with the kids.

I thought you might like to see the interview I've done with Eastbourne Buzz over the contentious issue of the councils proposal to sell the 4 Downland farms. Whichever way we look at it the issue is a real challenge, and the only reason the council are even contemplating it is because of the 50% cut the government have made to its allocated budget. A brutal reduction of around £5m pa.

Virtually all the councils across England (see Hastings, Brighton or our own county council as classic examples) have met these swingeing reductions by making similar sized cuts to frontline services. 

Something almost uniquely Eastbourne have avoided thus far.

Which brings me to the Downland Farms: I've tried to be fair in my interview below explaining the financial problems the council faces and how they believe the Downland Farms can still be protected. Equally to help ensure you have a rounded picture, I flag that there are others who feel passionately the farms must not be sold under any circumstances. 

So I hope that what I have to say in the interview with the Buzz is helpful to you in whatever decision you choose to make.

Dear All - an Eastbourne couple, Nick and Mandy Moon, recently contacted me about a fundraiser they are holding at the Ocean Suite on the Pier next weekend. It looks great fun and is truly for a heartwarming cause. Take a look at what they sent to me explaining all:

-------
'Our son Teddie was born last August 3 months early and weighed 1lb 8oz (around the weight of  a small bag of sugar). As a result he spent over 3 months in hospital, most of that time in an incubator at the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton on the Trevor Mann Baby Unit. (TMBU).
If it hadn't been for the doctors and nurses and the dedication that they have the chances are that Teddie wouldn't have survived.

Our little family would have had to spend a lot of time travelling to and from home to the hospital, but because the of the Ronald McDonald House Brighton which was built by the charity to house parents with sick children, we were able to live close to the hospital during Teddie's treatment. This charity is not funded by McDonalds and relies on charitable donations.
 
To raise money for these two fabulous charities – TMBU and the Ronald McDonald House Brighton - we decided to put on a fundraising dinner in our own town.  Eastbourne. And to make it really entertaining as well.....
 
So fresh from their tour of Australia, Comedy Dining are generously providing their popular Only Fools and Three Courses show for free. The show combines fine food and comedy action, served up ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES style. Del, Rodney, Uncle Albert, Raquel, Marlene and Boycie, all put in an appearance!!
 
An evening of chaos and mayhem with an extra-large portion of comedy is the order of the night. Expect a BIG FUN NIGHT OUT in a friendly party atmosphere with some of the finest comedy in the land with your enjoyment at the top of the menu.
 
Tickets are £45 per person includes a three course dinner, the show and a disco afterwards until 1am.

A report just published by the independent National Audit Office (NAO) has identified that the Tory government's free schools programme has significantly overspent, and under-delivered. 

The DfE pledged to spend £900m and open 315 schools but they have in fact spent £1.9bn to open 305 schools. A whopping billion pounds more than originally budgeted.

The report also pointed out that a fifth are in areas where 'no extra capacity' was needed!!

Furthermore, the NAO added: 'The programme is set to cost £10bn by 2020 at a time when £6.7bn is needed to keep existing school buildings at a satisfactory standard.'

A highly unusual demo took place outside Eastbourne Rail Station on Monday. Comprising reps from the Eastbourne Chamber of Commerce, the Eastbourne Hospitality Association, Best of Eastbourne and other business-people. 

Their simple point was:- it's time for the government to get 'everyone' around the negotiating table to sort the dispute which has been absolutely crippling for our town, and across the South East.

I couldn't agree more!

The strategy by Southern Rail, with support from the government, to 'divide' the unions has clearly not worked. This strike must be  resolved for the sake of our town, its businesses, its commuters and all those of us who need to use the train service. 

I applaud the Chamber for stepping up like this. Hopefully Chris Grayling the transport minister will actually take note and lift the phone this week, today even, to call Southern Rail/GTR and the unions requesting they sit down - together and with no pre conditions - to resolve the strike.

A young lass who lives in Langney, Tabitha, contacted me to explain how the bus company Stagecoach had stopped a special ticket called a UniRider which she used when attending the Brighton University campus in Meads. 

This removal of UniRider for Eastbourne students would mean that Tabitha and others like her in our town would have to pay an extra £150, which is a lot of money to find if you're a young person. 

Furthermore - after we did a bit of digging I discover that Stagecoach have 'not' stopped the availability of UniRider in other towns such as Chichester, York, Newcastle etc

I heard yesterday that East Sussex had, once again, rejected Leanna's Appeal to receive transport payments so her son could continue to go to his college in Eastbourne. 

After the Local Government Ombudsman accepted their were concerns over the original appeal and that County should re-visit the issue, this second rejection  is a real blow for the family. 

I am profoundly disappointed at their decision. 

It appears the county council are saying that as Leanna is working. (She has a job as a teacher). She should find the £500 a month or so to pay for Billy's school transport herself. The reality of course is a teachers wages will simply not sustain another £500 to be taken from the household budget every month.

I believe East Sussex County Council are wrong in their decision and I fear the consequences. It would be appalling for Leanna to remove Billy from the school life that he loves and it would be equally appalling for Leanna, a dedicated teacher, to leave her job so that her son can continue to receive an education.

1632026600406302_1884954535113506,"April Disability cuts still going ahead: 

Some of you may remember me flagging a few months ago that the government (then under the auspices of the un-lamented George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith) was changing the rules around the WRAG section of the ESA? 

Apologies for the acronyms but essentially WRAG is an additional work-related entitlement a disabled person gets, who may have been out of work for a long time, but are still actively seeking work. 

The rationale for its original introduction which I supported as your MP, was that if a disabled person was unemployed but keen to try and get back to work, then the additional £30pw from WRAG would encourage them to try and get a job. Which seems pretty sensible to me!

Unfortunately from April that £30pw is being cut. 

I think this is a boneheaded decision as it is likely to put off many disabled people from actively seeking employment, and, instead encourage them to move into what's called the Support Group where you do not have to seek work. 

And that's not a criticism of people with a disability - it's stating the bleeding obvious...

Because if I was disabled, had been out of work for a long time but was really trying hard to get back into employment, and you threatened to cut my weekly income by 30% at a stroke, then frankly I'd move heaven and earth to get into the Support Group where at least my income would be safe. This is about basic living standards here folks; not gold plated taps!

I am also intensely disappointed at how the DWP and many Tory MP's keep spinning the line that it will 'only' affect new claimants and that no-one currently on WRAG has anything to fear.

This is not true - and I've three points for them:

Firstly, does that utterly mendacious statement, excuse what will be incredibly tough for disabled people newly joining WRAG from this April onwards? 

Secondly, do they take disabled people for fools? They know perfectly well that every few years they're reassessed for WRAG, so whilst you may not be affected this April, you will be soon enough.

And thirdly, it actually 'will' apply to many existing WRAG claimants because also this April nearly half a million people who are currently on ESA WRAG will start to migrate to universal credit (UC). And the Government intend to remove the 'limited capability for work component' of the work element of universal credit. Meaning that everyone currently on ESA WRAG will ultimately be transferred to UC and have their support reduced by £1,500 a year.

In short. A bad business with a hefty sleight of hand added to the mix......

I've pasted a link below to the original story which was in the Mirror last year as the Lords tried to block it, but was ultimately rammed though by the gov.

I hope, even at this late stage, the DWP will cancel this dreadful cut. It's retrogressive, cruel and counter-productive. 

I also hope our MP will be fighting her disabled constituents corner hard on this for though she voted through the cut last year, surely the unfair consequences are now obvious and perhaps a change of mind might be in order?

Because if anyone seriously thinks that the most effective way to encourage people into jobs, is to cut their income by 30%, perhaps they could lead by example with their own salary.....

I recently saw an absolutely shocking piece in the media detailing the number of assaults against prison staff over the last few years, and how it has got significantly worse. A female warden was being interviewed and she said, with feeling, that every day she went into work she was in fear of being assaulted.

This is just not good enough. 

I appreciate we have a serious problem of over-crowding in our prisons, I also believe the gov have cut probation services too far in their cost-cutting exercise which, naturally, is having a negative impact on the number of prisoners reoffending.

But assaulting staff when they are trying their level best to do a difficult job which, frankly, most of us wouldn't want to do, is simply not right. And the increase in the number of assaults is also a very worrying trend.

Consequently when by coincidence I was contacted by a former constituent who now works in the Prison Service in London, asking if I would support a petition to protect staff being attacked, I was and am very much on board.

This is just a little of what he had to say (details deleted to protect his anonymity):

-----
""Hello Stephen, my names is xxxx. I recently moved out of the eastbourne area but was a huge supporter of you while living there and believe you have a great influence on the local public's opinion. I am currently x length of time into being a prison officer and in the last few years violence and serious assaults on staff and prisoners has shot through the roof. To the point seeing people with bloody faces, stab wounds and all sorts of holes in their body has become the norm for me. A lot of staff including myself do often fear for our lives while going to work everyday. Please can you put the link to this petition on your Facebook page.""

The play - Shell Shock - really was a very powerful piece of theatre. All about a young soldier having left the Army and dealing with post traumatic stress disorder, and its consequences. A difficult and challenging issue as you can imagine!

It's a solo performance, and the actor is a local lad called Tom Page. Frankly, I thought his portrayal was outstanding. Funny, vulnerable, angry, bitter - all in a trace and all very credible. 

The writer and director is from Eastbourne as well - Tim Marriott - who adapted it from a novel by Neil Watkin; a former soldier. Tim's done a very good job In the writing. There wasn't a wasted line throughout, which is unusual in adapted works. 

It was brilliant to see such a strong and I think quality work emanate from Eastbourne. Well done to the whole team. I wish them all the very best with the production as it goes on tour.

PTSD can be tremendosily debilitating, and as your MP I worked with a number of returning veterans over the years in trying to support them across a range of issues. From housing, employment and sadly, all too often, mental health issues. Much of the above were I am sure, part of the complicated PTSD jigsaw. 

It was an honour for me to help them, but I am very glad there are now many more organisations around like Combat Stress, to support those men and women of our armed services as they sometimes struggle getting back successfully into civilian life. They served on our behalf so, in my opinion, richly deserve all the support and care we as a nation can offer them.

Some of you may remember I flagged a few months ago a crowd-funded consumer legal challenge against the Department of Transports (Dft) over the Southern Rail dispute? Well I heard that they finally applied to court yesterday morning for a judicial review of the Dft's handling of the rail dispute. 

Please see the link below to their press release:

https://abcommuters.wordpress.com/2017/02/01/breaking-news-abc-apply-to-court-for-judicial-review-of-the-department-for-transport-over-southern-rail/

I have supported this initiative from the beginning as I know many of you have as well, so hope it will succeed. I note from their press release that one of its core issues is to flag up the failure of Southern Rail to provide an adequate service to disabled passengers with only one member of staff on a train. Some of you will recollect that a couple of weeks ago a disabled passenger was stuck on a train in Eastbourne as there was no other staff member on board to help them disembark, so they're JR is clearly in the right territory!

On the current talks with ASLEF. I am also pleased Southern Rail finally agreed to meet them with no pre-conditions, and I hope the talks bear fruit. My petition which went up a couple of months ago urged then that the Dft should ensure talks start as soon as possible and, crucially, with 'no pre-conditions' attached. 

But. And this is the big but. Why have Southern agreed just to meet with ALSEF and not the RMT under those terms? Are they (read the government here, as Southern do exactly what the Dft tells them to do) trying to prolong the dispute so passengers get more and more fed up with the Unions? I do hope not.

I am absolutely convinced that the only way to end this dispute so the long-suffering rail users can get a half decent service back, is to make the same offer to the RMT.

If you haven't already signed my petition, please follow the link below. The pressure it's brought on the regions conservative mp's to stand up for their constituents rather than just parrot the gov's line has - I've heard on the grapevine - been rather effective.....

Combining this with the beginnings of the judicial review yesterday will, I hope, persuade the Dft to actually lead the way out of this mess.

My last post was all about volunteers and an initiative in our town called Eastbourne Volunteers, and on Sunday I saw two very good examples of this in action.

Firstly the St Ants liberal pensioners lunch: It's always a great event and one in which I love going around the tables and catching up with everyone. Many of whom I've known ever since I was first selected as the parliamentary candidate in March 2002. Time flies.....

The really remarkable thing about this event though is its longevity - 37 years - and that David Tutt and Alan Shuttleworth started it together all those years ago, and it and they are still going strong! I've posted a pic of them serving up the food yesterday. I think they've aged pretty well...!

I then had the pleasure of heading over to join the Eastbourne Chinese Association to celebrate the Chinese New Year. A curious factoid is that I was one of the co-founders of the Association - a long story! They're a tremendous group and, again, it was nice to be amongst old friends.

The context of my post of course is that to ensure all the hundreds of guests at both events had a good time - it took a large number of volunteers giving up 'their' time freely to make it happen. And this goes on across Eastbourne every day of every week of every year. I know that, because I've visited and supported so many events large and small across the town over the years. And I'm always bowled over by the astonishing levels of commitment shown by so many of you for your respective organisations or causes. Hugely impressive.

I love the sense of community spirit that we have in Eastbourne. I also think it's a key part of our sense of place, a part of us which ensures we are a cohesive town, a town that tries to do its best to look out for and after its neighbours. 

That's not too say they're are no challenges; their are. I know that more than many, as have supported numerous people going through the most awful of times. It was always one of my absolute priorities as your MP to be there for residents in need and will be so again if I am re-elected. It's what I stand for and it's what I do.

But these challenges can't take away the fact our town is deeply community-focussed across the piece, and to me that is a great strength, and one we can all be proud of.

So if you are one of our many volunteers, thank you. And I hope you enjoyed yourselves as much as I did across Eastbourne over the weekend.

I wish Helen and her team at Eastbourne Volunteers the very best of luck with their new community enterprise. I feel sure it will prove to be a tremendous asset to our local volunteer sector for many years to come.",Photos from Stephen Lloyd MP's post

They're absolutely brilliant and I heartily recommend you get down there now to see the wide range available and snap up a  creative bargain. A fine if sad cause, as all the proceeds are to go toward paying for Kimberley's mum's funeral.

1632026600406302_1876746682600958,"Eastbourne Buzz - An Outstanding Local Media:

Many of you will already know of a new media outlet - Eastbourne Buzz - which started up in our town just under a year ago. The co founders are Sharon Williams and David Plummer; I'd known Sharon for years as she used to be the lead reporter for Sovereign Radio, as well as being an Eastbourne lass. 

Their breadth of coverage on local issues, big and small, has grown exponentially in quality and coverage over the last ten months. If you don't already know them check out the site here: http://eastbournebuzz.co.uk/

Now that they have built solid foundations they had a formal launch yesterday at the View Hotel. There was an excellent turnout of potential advertisers, local charity's, trade associations and dignitaries (Thx go to Cllr Pat Hearn our splendid Madam Mayor who made a lovely speech), and we heard more from David and Sharon of the Buzz's progress and plans for the future of the company.

The audience numbers are now very impressive with the website regularly getting between 30,000 to 40,000 uniques viewers every month. A sizeable figure for Eastbourne which I am sure will keep growing not least as they continue, often, to be the lead on breaking local stories. They're also thoroughly nice people which is a bonus! I even forgive them, almost, for pinching my original strapline when I was your MP of: ""Putting the Buzz back onto Eastbourne....!!""

Anyway, it was a pleasure to be at the launch and to speak on their support. I believe we all benefit from a strong community based video and online news outlet, and Eastbourne Buzz do an excellent job covering a broad range of stories. 

They see their mission to 'report' what is going on from a neutral perspective allowing the viewer to hear all sides. I think this is particularly important when so much of our media tends to be slanted so obviously toward one political strand or another irrespective of the facts. Eastbourne Buzz report the news fairly and factually, which is important. 

They also cover a lot of community news and initiatives which I particularly welcome. I'm convinced that a core strength of Eastbourne is our deep sense of community, our desire to help and look out for our neighbours - so knowing that your story, your practical efforts in the community may be shown to a broader audience is, I think, another one of their key plus-points.

So folks if you haven't seen what they do before, then make a habit of checking out their website regularly for stories and updates. And also contact them if you think you've some local news which may be of interest. 

If you are a potential advertiser please see below a few additional details for info. They're reaching an awful lot of people, your customers, every month!!

Good luck Sharon and Dave - I wish you every success for the future - and see you soon when another story breaks.......

I had the pleasure yesterday of meeting with fellow Old Town resident Anwar Akchich at St Wilfred's. He is doing an absolutely astonishing fundraiser to raise money for St Wilf's and Macmillan Cancer Support on behalf of his mum, who sadly died last June.

Let him explain: ""Recently my family has been hit with the devastating news that my beautiful mum has terminal cancer so this has driven me to try and make something good come from this terrible situation. So I planned to train for an ironman but it just didn't seem ""big enough"" so together with my good friend and local personal trainer  Jon Morgan Nanny Pats ""BIG 10"" was born...The challenge now consists of 10 serious endurance events in 12 months, basically an event every 6 weeks for a year!!! 
So Here's the list......
1. The south coast challenge 100 Kilometres
2. 1066 way to Battle: 17 Miles
3. Beachy Head Marathon: 26.2 Miles
4. London to Brighton ultra marathon 100 kilometres. 
5. Brighton Half Marathon: 13.1 Miles
6. Hastings Half Marathon: 13.1 Miles
7. Brighton Marathon: 26.2 miles
8. Eastbourne Triathlon: 600mt sea swim/25km road cycle/5.4km run
9. South Coast Olympic Triathlon: 1500mt  swim/40km bike ride/10km run
10. Ironman: 2.4mile open water swim/112mile bike ride/26.2mile  run.
I am under no illusion of how hard this will be for me both physically and mentally as I am no athlete, but I have no doubt at all that I will smash everyone of these events because however hard it gets for me along the way its nothing compared to living just one day with cancer. I ask all of you from the bottom of my heart to please donate whatever you can afford to either or both of these amazing charities who help so many people fighting this awful disease. Please share across social media, tell your friends and follow my progress on Facebook, oh and if you see a guy running around Sussex in a bright yellow t-shirt then give me a beep and a wave. Love to you all, Anwar of nannypatsbig10""

There you have it. Anwar has already done three events, with another seven to do and is well on his way to hitting his donations target. An incredibly ambitious and challenging endurance effort!

I asked him why St Wilfred's? And his answer, as someone who lost my own beloved mum ten years ago this April, hit me to the core: 

""when the Hospice to Home nurses came to see about moving my mum to St Wilfred's I had to tell them she'd just passed away. They asked that I go out into the garden to choose a flower for her and to have a little think in her memory. When I returned they had prepared her beautifully, which meant that my last memory of my mum isn't of the moment she passed, but of her lying their gentle and composed. 

I gave her the flower. 

And I will thank the Hospice for the rest of my life for giving me that, as my last memory of my mum.""

Well said Anwar my friend. It's a pleasure to support you in your incredible fundraiser Nanny Pats BIG 10, and I just know your mother would be proud of you and what you are doing to help St Wilfred's and Macmillan Cancer Support.

See his FB page below folks and also his justgiving link. Please take a look, share far and wide and if you are able to support by donating I know that Anwar will be profoundly grateful. Thx.

It was a scheme to bring young people of the ages 15 - 17 together from across a wide variety of backgrounds, and teach them a load of things such as leadership skills, problem solving, team work etc. It's been tremendously successful across the UK and in Eastbourne, grown exponentially. 

I've seen it absolutely transform some youngsters lives which is why I was - and remain - a big fan of the imitative. Do check out their website above for info.

I mention all this because a young guy from Langney who took part in the NCS programme a few years ago - Hedy Galal - contacted me recently to let me know of a business he has started. A mobile car wash company called Gloss Mobile Valeting. 

We had a chat and he brought me up to speed with his ongoing involvement in NCS. How he went on to become a team leader mentoring other young people; and how much he felt he'd got out of the project. 

And now Hedy and his Dad have started this new business. And good for them. 

It is a very competitive market but a high quality mobile car valeting service that 'delivers' always has a good chance of success. See their FB page here:https://m.facebook.com/GlossMobileValeting/ for info. I've also attached their leaflet below.

They certainly did an excellent job on my ten year old Rover 75 outside my house in Old Town, and the pricing is competitive considering they come to you. Try them out folks. I was impressed!

So - good luck Hedy with the new business. 

And I was really pleased to hear just how much of a positive difference you believe NCS made to you.

See an interview below that I did with Eastbourne Buzz. 

I believe it is imperative that the Secretary of State, Chris Grayling, gets Southern Rail to make the same offer to the RMT as they've done with Aslef - in other words come to the negotiating table with 'no' pre-conditions.

I also believe the RMT will accept this and proper negotiations can then take place so a compromise is found which gets our Rail service back to normal. 

Without this I fear the union will continue its strike actions.

In short, what I am asking Grayling is if it's good enough for Aslef why not the RMT? 

Or are the government so determined to break the union they are prepared to let towns like Eastbourne continue to suffer......

This means that more often than not, the parent has to change their child's nappy on the floor of the usual toilet. This is undignified and embarrassing for the disabled child (or adult) and all concerned.

The petition below is asking that their should be decent provision to cater for people in this situation. I think this is only fair and reasonable. Actually I'd go further than that and say it's what a decent, civilised society should provide!

Stephen this is my letter to the Chief Exec of the DGH:

On Wednesday 4th January 2017 my Doctors advised I attend A & E as I was experiencing acute pain within my chest and am currently being treated for a chest infection with steroids and antibiotics.

Whilst at A & E I was then referred on to your Ambulatory Care Unit who conducted the following investigations:

• A chest X-Ray
• Blood tests
• CT Scan
• Regular Obs
• An ECG

The team on the Ambulatory Care Unit were professional, friendly and worked so well together.  I felt informed and reassured that all was being done to investigate the sources of pain.

In addition sandwiches and coffee were supplied to us and my partner made to feel welcomed and kept up to date too of my wellbeing.

What was outstanding was the smooth running of the Unit.  I was there all day and the Staff Nurse, Diane and the Health Care Assistant Grace worked so well together and maintained all patients’ spirits up as far as I could see. 

Please convey my thanks to your Unit, especially to the wonderful 
Consultant Dr Leonard who even took the trouble to ring me later with a concern regarding my medication. In my opinion he leads by example.  

The result was I had cracked ribs!  

The NHS and the DGH are truly amazing and need all the positive feedback and support today and always.

Dear All - I'm sure most of you know of our wonderful parade of shops in Old Town, Albert Parade, but I just wanted to give all of Eastbourne (and beyond) the heads-up on their latest initiative. 

A few weeks ago I had a meeting with some of the traders and we were brainstorming about doing a bit of a marketing push for this month. The plan was to take out a full page advert in the Herald reminding folk of just how much it has to offer. They're aren't many traditional parades left these days across the whole of the UK, let alone in East Sussex, where you can still find a butcher, greengrocer, bakery, post office, kiddies clothes shop and much more, so they agreed to give it a go. 

I then visited and spoke with a bunch of the other shops who weren't able to make our meeting to get their buy-in and was struck, yet again, by the tremendous community spirit which exits between the traders on the Parade. 

Do pop along for a look-see if you haven't been for a while. It's well worth a visit.

There has been a lot - even more than usual - in the media recently over the funding crisis which is affecting our NHS; lengthening queues in A&E's across the country, folk not being able to go home because their is no care package organised for them etc.
And underpinning all this is the crumbling fabric of our social care costs which have been under-funded, frankly, for thirty years.

In the immediate term we need a serious injection from the government of extra funds to get us through this winter before it really does get as bad as the Red Cross recently pronounced. Then we need 'all' the political party's to work together to agree a sustainable funding model for both the NHS and Social Care long into the future.

One of my colleagues when I was your MP is a guy called Norman Lamb. He is a good man and a 'serious' politician who has been active on health issues for 20 years. Norman is liked and respected across the piece in Westminster. And he's got together with some senior mp's from the other political party's to lobby Theresa May that this is such a huge issue facing ALL of us, the only productive way forward is to agree a major cross-party approach. 

I have pasted below a little of what he has said. Please take a look, sign the petition and share my post.

Thanks folks, as ever.

 
From Norman Lamb MP:
""Since Parliament returned from the winter break, I’ve been working non-stop on a campaign for a new funding deal for the NHS and social care services – but now I need your help.
 
Everyone knows that the NHS and care system is in dire straits.  Funding has failed to keep up with unprecedented demand for healthcare – and every day we are seeing the consequences of this.  Patients facing longer waits in A&E.  Over a million vulnerable older people not receiving the social care they need.  And only last week, I recently uncovered a huge rise in the number of mental health patients stuck in hospital because of a lack of support in the community.
 
We are facing a crisis no single party can fix.  Partisan politics and political point-scoring has completely failed to come up with a solution, and a fresh approach is desperately needed. 
 
So this week, I got together with more than 20 MPs from Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, calling on the Prime Minister to set up a cross-party NHS and Care Convention to find a new, long-term funding settlement for our cherished health and social care services.
 
This would engage NHS staff, patients, carers, and the wider public in a national conversation about how we can guarantee a strong and effective NHS and care system which is sustainable for the future. 
 
At the same time, a group of 75 leading organisations in the health and care sector – including Independent Age, Marie Curie, and the Royal College of GPs – have joined in the call for all parties to put aside their differences and work together on a solution to this national crisis.
 
This could be the start of something special – and at Prime Minister’s Questions this afternoon, Theresa May agreed to meet with me and other MPs to allow us to make our case for a cross-party approach.
 
The Prime Minister is starting to listen – so now is the time to make your voice heard.  The Government will never agree to work with other parties and set up an NHS and Care Convention unless it knows that is what the public wants. So I am asking you to support this campaign by signing an online petition calling on Theresa May to seek an urgent cross-party solution to the health and care crisis.""

Some of you may know that unfortunately, over the last few months, we have had a spate of tyre-slashing and other damage to vehicles in Old Town; around Milton Road, Motcombe, Gore Park Rd etc. (See map below highlighting the worst affected areas put together by a local resident, for which many thanks). 

I've been liaising with our local police who assure me they are doing everything they can to apprehend the culprits.

However, on top of this, I'm sorry to also have to report that St Elisabeth's Church, on Victoria Drive was broken into yesterday. Their Church Manager Mandy Mulford told me that this is the 6th time they've been burgled in only four months. Furthermore, some of the goods which were stolen were those donated by the community to help the family in Colwood Crescent, who had the horror of their house catching fire only a week or so ago. This is just appalling frankly!

The ongoing catalogue of petty crime in our lovely town is simply not on and like many other Old Town residents I've had enough.

So I've a proposal to put out there: 

Some residents have indicated to me that they know, or suspect they know, who the culprits might be but for one reason or another are anxious about going to the police. My suggestion therefore, is if one of my FB friends 'do' know or 'suspect' they know any of the people involved - or have any pointers which would help the police stop this wave of vandalism and theft - to either private message me on my FB or email me at: stephen@stephenlloyd.org.uk with their information. I will relay it personally to the police, and rest assured I'll not break anyone's anonymity without permission.

I know that many of my Eastbourne FB friends also knew him and so, with the okay from his wife Jackie, I would like to post my own tribute:

In the ten years or so I had the privilege of calling Angelo my friend, every moment spent with him was of value; either through enjoying his irrepressible humour or straightforward common sense.

Amongst the many roles he played in our town, he was one of the first people I asked to join my Carnival committee when we began planning to return it to Eastbourne. He was, amongst other things, our lead on health and safety. A crucial role in the modern age for any major event. Naturally he stepped up and gave us literally hundreds of hours of his time. Something he did behind the scenes at many of the events in Eastbourne over the years - from Airbourne to our International tennis tournament - and pretty much all points in between.

He'd spent many years in the Fire Service before retiring from the Service to Eastbourne, and had reached the illustrious height of Deputy Chief Fire Officer. Angelo always used to pull my leg at formal events as his dress uniform far outshone my feeble lounge suit efforts, as can be seen in the pic below at a past Mayors Ball! 

His wonderful wife Jackie is standing behind me. Our thoughts and prayers go out to her and the children, Bianca & Angelo Junior.

Angelo was also a stalwart of the Eastbourne Lib Dems and his constant support to us and me personally was something I cherished deeply.

Hopefully we'll now get to a sensible compromise which will allow Eastbourne (and beyond) rail commuters and businesses to get back on the front foot.

And it was obvious that Grayling would 'only' listen to the Tory mp's in the South East and whilst they simply parroted the gov's line there was no chance of a working compromise, which is why I lit a fire under them with my petition.

Have you noticed for instance the Win a Car comp which runs in the Arndale Centre for 24 days up to Christmas Eve?

Then there's bag-packing. I'm sure you have seen that most of the supermarkets (special mention here of ESK and their owner Bob Beevis who is always tremendously supportive) allow charities to collect for their cause whilst helping the customers pack their bags. Just imagine how many volunteers that takes? x supermarket aisle = y volunteers......

Or staff at work who put on a special event in their own time and cost for others, such as the team who did a fantastic Xmas dinner last week for youngsters from foster care. Or all the other Christmas party's that went on across our town - from Embrace (for disabled children) to Purple Hearts (for children with epilepsy) and all points in-between, of the many, many other volunteer organisations who put on something extra for Christmas. 

All of these of course, take hundreds and hundreds of volunteers to become a reality.

Even in politics, over the last two weeks alone one young lass on hols from university came to help in the office (thank you Ellen) and another, a local teacher, just knocked on our door to ask what could he do to help me become the town's MP again (thank you Chris) - both out of the blue, stepping up as volunteers.

And not forgetting on Christmas Day itself; the fabulous lunch put on at Our Lady of Ransome for a hundred people or so who are home-alone. This takes dozens of volunteers; to prepare and cook the food, to pick up and drop off the guests, to serve them and to provide entertainment. Every year - a fine Eastbourne tradition.

Which of course brings me to one of our greatest Xmas traditions locally and that's at the Bandstand, where I was this year on Christmas Day. They're must have been well over a thousand people enjoying our brilliant Silver Band. All the musicians are of course - volunteers!

Two local charity's, St Wilfred's and the Eastbourne branch of Cancer Research Trust (thank you Janet and Lee) were manning the collection buckets for their causes. I was helping the latter along with another youngster who had contacted me to say she would like to do some volunteering (here's to you Lydia) and it was enormous fun. Hard work but fun.

The mood was lovely, many stopped for a quick chat, the band were in fine fettle, the sun was out and people were their usual generous selves. The other ten or so volunteer bucket collectors, I am sure, had an equally enjoyable couple of hours.

Of course, my examples are just a tiny proportion of the many thousands of people who volunteer across Eastbourne (and beyond) every week of every month of every year. But if I listed them all my FB post would surpass by a factor of ten even my posts - which I'm aware are a tad on the long side.....sorry folks!!

So this message is by way of me thanking you for what you do for our town.

I am in awe of the number of people in Eastbourne who give up so much of their time freely for others so often. Thank you all. Truly.

1632026600406302_1858419214433705,"Merry Christmas to my FaceBook followers:

Thanks to all of you for your support and interest through the year. Really appreciated.

Any way you look at it, 2016 has been an immensely turbulent year politically one way or t'other! In Syria the carnage has been dreadful and still ongoing even since the fall of Aleppo, and the nihilistic barbarism of Isis continues to spread its tentacles into Europe. 

Meanwhile Donald Trump is to be the new President in the US, and no-one can be sure exactly what that will bring! Even our own Brexit, whatever ones views, is certainly a political change of seismic proportions for the UK.

It seems to me that the one word which sums up 2016 best is 'entrenchment'. Each side of any argument, conflict or opinion digging ferociously into their own position whilst hurling rocks at the other, either literally or metaphorically.

Locally we have our own version with the ongoing saga of Southern Rail. The government, the rail company and the unions totally dug in. Each refusing to compromise, each preferring like so many others this year to go down the ‘rock throwing’ route. 

So is my Christmas message to you all bleak? 

Nope. Anything but.

Because there is another way. Of co-operation, of support; and I saw a wonderful local  example of this just the other day. As many of you will already know I was contacted by a council service called Through Team, who support youngsters from foster and residential care between the ages of 16 – 21. They asked if I could help get some presents for these young people for a Christmas Party the Team were putting on. 

I was absolutely delighted to do this as lets face it - imagine you’re 17 years old, been in foster care all your young life and its Christmas time, family time, and you don’t have many presents or a loving family atmosphere to revel in? It's a tough break folks, a really tough break. So I asked the Team how many presents they would like and they told me fifty; twenty five for the boys and twenty five for the girls. 

I went onto my Facebook to ask for help - and you responded. Over 200 presents were donated. An absolutely astonishing figure!!

And I had the pleasure of attending their Xmas party this week. It was a privilege to be there.  

So to conclude, it's been a funny old year and no-one can be sure what 2017 will bring, but there is one thing I can be absolutely certain of - and that is a very good reason why I love Eastbourne - is it's profound sense of community. It's willingness to step up for its own.

Thank you my friends.

Happy Christmas to you and yours......

A few years ago I was approached at one of the regular surgeries I used to hold as your MP - in Asda I think it was - by a young couple who were fired up about what they called 'street dance' - and how they'd like to introduce it to Eastbourne.

Now to be honest I knew as much then about street dancing as I did parachuting (which I've subsequently done and yes - it's a tad nervewracking) but was hugely impressed by the couple. Rob and Chloe Gregg was their name.

And since then I've seen a number of performances done by the troupe and they've been incredible. The energy, the moves, the obvious bond the students have with each other - all are impressive. 

The longer term goal though was always to open their own studio in Eastbourne, so I was really pleased to be there when it finally happened and cut the ribbon.

1632026600406302_1840712322871061,"Chancellors Autumn Statement - Disappointing!

The new Chancellors (pic below) first Autumn Statement left important gaps and will penalise a lot of ordinary people. No mention of the NHS or our growing Social Care needs in all 72 pages of the Autumn Statement! This is despite urgent calls for additional funds for both services, which we keep hearing are in a state of financial crisis. It is astonishing that the Chancellor did not mention these vital public services even once.

And the bulk of George Osborne’s stringent welfare cuts are set to go ahead, including no help at all for those disabled people trying to find work, with the proposed 30% reduction to their income remaining unchanged. I think this is simply wrong.

The Chancellor also announced an increase to 12% for all insurance premiums. In total, it means premiums have doubled since 2015 under the Conservative Government. The means the typical family will now have to pay an extra £90 a year compared to 2015.

Compare the decisions above with today's announcement that the government have said they will allocate an extra £240m in this parliament to deliver the expansion of grammar schools! 

I think this is completely the wrong priority and will of course benefit the already privileged, when they could have invested the extra money to improve 'all' our schools.

One of the pleasures I've had over the years is meeting and getting to know many veterans who proudly served during World War II. I'd like to tell you a little of one local residents active service history as I think it encapsulates what so many did on our behalf. 

His name is Mr George Thornton.

I came to know him through his daughter Val, who was one of my wonderful receptionist volunteers when I was your MP.

George's story is, I'm sure, like many others. Parents and grandparents who stepped up for our Nation when it was needed, and whose sacrifice we quietly remember on the 11th of the 11th every year.

.......

'George had a long war serving from 1941 - 1946. He did basic training at HMS Ganges in Ipswich, and then after training was posted to HMS Marigold a corvet, which was unfortunately torpedoed and sunk off Algiers. Thankfully he survived and was then drafted to the battleship HMS Cumberland, which was deployed in the bitterly cold Arctic Ocean as part of the regular and vital Russian Convoy's. After VE Day Cumberland was sent to join the East Indies Fleet based in Trinco Malee Ceylon which is now Sri Lanka, where they were mostly convoying troop ships crossing the Indian Ocean for what was anticipated to be the final theatre of the War. At the end, VJ day, HMS Cumberland was sent to take the Japanese surrender of Java where George joined the landing parties along with his shipmates securing important public amenities i.e power station, water supplies, docks etc, in Batavia now known as Jarkata.

Finally in Dec 1946 HMS Cumberland returned to the UK and he was drafted to HMS Mulborough, which is now Eastbourne College, where they were de-mobbed.'
.......

Almost 70 years later Mr Thornton returned to be near his daughter Val in Eastbourne, where he'd left the service all those years ago. His life has come full circle.

Thank you George for all you and your comrades did for us at our most perilous time.

There is to be a managed transition period up to April next year which is probably a good idea as the service has been pretty grim for patients (and staff!) at times.

Dear All - many of you will have read on my Facebook over the last few weeks of the deplorable situation of our local patient transport service. And how many of the drivers were not paid when they should have been and that some still have yet to receive their salaries for the work done throughout August.

This is a dreadful situation and it all stems from the decision by the High Weald CCG last April, to move the contract from the NHS SECAMB service to a private company called Coperforma. Who in turn sub-contracted to a number of other private ambulance company's. One of which is called Dockland Medical Services (DMS) who employ former NHS Drivers from Eastbourne and the surrounding area. They (DMS) have been late in paying staff (some even have yet to receive their August wages) and have in turn indicated they're still owed money from invoices presented to Coperforma.

The whole service since April has been a litany of failure. Patients not picked up when they should have been and in some cases not picked up at all! Staff not being paid, drivers fuel cards running on empty, NHS terms and conditions dumped and much more besides.

All of this sits at the feet of the High Weald CCG and their Chief Operating Officer, Wendy Carberry. Make no mistake the CCG had the responsibility as the guardians of taxpayers money and they accepted Coperforma's assurances of a better service for patients.

And it is clear this has not happened!

It's a worse service for patients and a significantly worse deal for our former NHS and incredibly dedicated drivers.

It is time in my opinion for the CCG to take back control of the service. To take responsibility for their lamentable decision to out-source NHS patient transport to the private contractor Coperforma.

The High Weald CCG must do the right thing to reassure local people - and they must do it now.

They need to cancel the contract with Coperforma on performance grounds and return non-urgent patient transport services to a credible NHS provider.

If you agree with me folks please click on the link below and sign my petition. We need to keep the pressure up on the CCG because they are the only ones with the clout to deal with Coperforma and, frankly, they are the ones who gave them the contract in the first place!

As we know today is EU Referendum Day, so I thought I'd post two brief pointers for my FB friends.

Firstly - I will be voting for us to Remain in the EU as I genuinely consider it to be in our best interests to do so. I won't re-hash all the arguments though, as by now I suspect you've had enough facts and statistics to last a lifetime. Other than to add this really 'is' an important vote as it will decide the whole direction of our country (and beyond) for many years to come - so do please vote. It's important that all of those who can have their say.

Which brings me to my second point: This has, at times, been an incredibly fractious referendum campaign so I think it is important that politicians - of all political colours - respect and accept the democratic will of the people once the result is known. Remain or Leave!

I profoundly believe that afterwards we must pull together to make the very best of whatever momentous decision the country decides. We do work better when we act in harness - be it in Eastbourne or across the UK - and nothing would sadden me more or be more counter-productive for the good of our nation if we continue such a bitter fight after the result.

1632026600406302_1696910837251211,"Dear All - it was good to visit a tremendous new shop in Albert Parade today. It's called Mini Madam and Mini Gent @ 145 Green Street (almost opposite Trident) in Old Town.

They opened just before Christmas and specialise in clothes for very young children. 

I'm absolutely delighted to support them and to see that Albert Parade continues, rightly, to attract good quality independent retailers.

It's a local mum and daughter team. Danielle, the daughter, is a fully trained clothes designer and one of the shops USP's is she designs and makes a whole range of kids clothes herself. This is really important - as she emphasised to me - because it means many of the outfits people buy from the shop will be genuinely unique!!

I think it's a brilliant (and highly skilled) offer. Danielle is clearly absolutely passionate about what she does and Sam, her mum, is behind her daughter 100%. So if you're a young mum or Dad, do pop in to have a look at what their offering. 

There are loads of young families in Old Town and across Eastbourne, Albert Parade is a perfect site and I know they'll both be absolutely thrilled to welcome you and your little ones......",Photos from Stephen Lloyd MP's post

The final US presidential primary debate this year for the Republican Party was held last night in Las Vegas. Read the report below from an excellent online current affairs site called the Daily Beast. It really is extraordinary to think that one of these people could well become President of the most powerful nation on earth this time next year. I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry.

Read on (and with thanks to the Daily Beast)  Authors: Tim Mak & Jackie Kucinich
 

A GOP Debate ISIS Would Love - From carpet bombings that would kill scores of civilians to Muslim blockades to Internet bans, the Republican debate sent a message to American viewers: Be afraid.
 
If one of the goals of ISIS is to scare the American people - the GOP Debate did them a service on Tuesday night in Las Vegas - ratcheting up the fearful rhetoric, and combining it with ideas that were at times ignorant or illegal.

From carpet bombings that would kill scores of civilians to Muslim blockades to Internet bans, the Republican debate sent a message to American viewers: Be afraid.

It plays right into ISIS’s hands: As a terrorist organization that is outmatched in brute strength by the United States, one of its most potent tools is psychological. It can use fear to provoke an overreaction. And boy, did the Republicans overreact.

Forget that an American is more likely to be fatally crushed by furniture than killed in a terrorist attack. Cue instead Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, talking about nuclear weapons: “The power, the devastation, is very important to me,” Trump said.

Absent is the sunny optimism of Ronald Reagan, a president many of the GOP candidates have quoted and idolized. Gone is the they’ll-hear-from-us resolve that George W. Bush showed after the 9/11 attacks. Instead, we heard from Carly Fiorina, saying, “Like all of you, I’m angry.”

Chris Christie added, “America has been betrayed.”   

This wasn’t unexpected. Given the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, the country and - particularly the Republican electorate - are on high alert.

But it wasn’t only dark rhetoric: The Republican debate featured proposals that can only be considered dangerous or stupid. Like he’s doing in the polls, Trump led the field on this account, proposing that the United States try to ban ISIS from using the Internet.

“We should be using our brilliant people, our most brilliant minds to figure a way that ISIS cannot use the Internet,” the businessman said.

Trump didn’t suggest any actual way to accomplish this, and given that the so-called Islamic State widely known as ISIS is backed by an ideology that can be taken up by individuals all throughout the world—individuals who cannot be easily identified or constrained to a particular region—the proposal is a non-starter.

The businessman was not only proposing nonsensical ideas, but also ones that violate American commitment regarding humane treatment of civilians. Trump again supported violence against the families of terrorists, which goes against the well-established principles of international law.

“I would be very, very firm with families,” Trump said. “Frankly, that will make people think because they may not care much about their lives, but they do care, believe it or not, about their families’ lives.”

He (Trump) was called out by Rand Paul, who pointed out that his policies would throw out years of legal precedent—not to mention involve withdrawing from a key international treaty.

But Trump was not alone in a willingness to accept the deaths of innocent civilians and potentially commit war crimes. When asked by conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt whether he would be “OK with the deaths of thousands of innocent children and civilians,” Ben Carson responded: “You got it. You got it.”

And Sen. Ted Cruz has said he wants to “carpet-bomb” ISIS, which would essentially require blanketing urban, ISIS-held areas like Raqqa with munitions. Since ISIS hides among civilian populations, such actions would almost certainly kill scores of non-combatants, and could be considered a war crime if it could be shown that the U.S. was intentionally attacking civilians. The very nature of carpet-bombing is that it is imprecise, destroying entire areas without discrimination.

Other Republicans were merely wrong. Businesswoman Carly Fiorina said that she would “bring back the warrior class,” listing off retired generals like David Petraeus that she would consult as president. “Everyone was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn’t want to hear,” she said.

Eh, not quite. Petraeus was forced to retire as director of the CIA for allegedly giving classified documents to his biographer, with whom he was having an affair......

Back to me folks: What can I say other than what do these charlatans have to say to actually be beyond the pale? 

Or maybe the mood with their angry/fearful American Republican electorate is that 'nothing' is off-limits. Nothing at all.

Now that is a scary if not completely bonkers situation.

1632026600406302_1681591592116469,"Working Tax Credit update:

I am delighted the Chancellor George Osborne has done a complete about-turn on his proposed savage cuts to working tax credits. They would have been utterly devastating for thousands of hard working people in Eastbourne and their families. Around £1200pa to be precise.

The basic questions though, that I do have for him and all the Tory MP's who voted 'for' the cuts in Parliament over the last few months, including our own MP are:

Why were you prepared to target the working poor so aggressively and only changed tack when you were forced by the House of Lords?

Didn't you really care about just how hard such a punitive cut would have been to working families on low incomes. 

Finally. Is this really what you went into politics for?",

Essentially, the company I now work for - West End - have been commissioned by the Eastbourne Chamber of Commerce to put on a light show against the fabric of the Town Hall clock tower called NEON NOEL. 

From the 4th to 13th December, with three shows a day - 4.30, 5.30 and 6.30pm.

See the two links below - they explain in more detail:

2/ Herald - http://m.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/local/first-glimpse-of-the-christmas-lightshow-at-eastbourne-town-hall-1-7060377
 
The Chamber this year has really pushed the boat out on behalf of our town - not just Neon Noel, but even more Christmas lights than last year and, as you'll see from their internet link, a really fantastic looking Xmas Market is also being run from the Bandstand. 

As far as Neon Noel's concerned - do make a note in your diary to come and see what I can say without hesitation, will absolutely blow your socks off - at whatever age you are!!

We would like to say a massive thank you to everyone who took part in, and helped at, our charity golf day last Sunday 9th August at Willingdon golf club. On a gloriously sunny day 15 teams of 4 took part in a Texas scramble. 

Thank you to Lisa, Theo, Evelyn, Nina and of course Abby who made such yummy cakes for the players to have with their drinks at the half-way house. Thank you also to Mark and Judy for your patience when taking all those marvellous photos, to Katie McDonald for dealing with all the money and Helen Withdean And Thomas for their help on the day (especially with the gazebo). 

Thank you to everybody at Willingdon golf club for their help and support during the day, especially Rachel and Steve for the marvellous meal they prepared for over 80 people. Thank you to Sussex Cars for sponsoring the event and to all the other 18 companies for sponsoring a hole. Thank you especially to club captain, John Bigsby, for doing the prize giving and a big thank you to Stephen Lloyd and his partner Cherine for continuously supporting and publicising our charity events. Stephen still manages to light up the room with his enthusiasm. Why you are not still our MP is a mystery to me and many others!!

And to Andy Curry and everybody at PlanAhead for their generous help with the brilliant signage. Really appreciated.

And finally - congratulations to the winning team (see picture below) of John Cook, Naz, Tom Colerio and Paul Moores, and the runners up, beaten by only 0.75 of a shot of Andy McPhee Darren Allistone, Chris Scarborough And Dave Allistone.

The recent brilliant Ofsted Report along with the commitment of all the staff, students and parents at Shinewater are testimony to just how good schools can be even if they don't have the catchment area advantages and financial benefits some other schools have been gifted with. I'd like to congratulate the Head Theresa Buttery for her superb leadership and her extraordinary staff. They are all doing Langney proud. 

And a big thx to the children for inviting me, and for your generous and thoughtful words of my time as your MP. I was always very proud to be an advocate of the school. 

Education and opportunity's to shine, particularly for children from more disadvantaged areas, was always one of my passions (as was jobs!). We should all have the same rights to succeed - all we need is to believe in ourselves. And a great school can help install that confidence; that belief. Shinewater Primary has clearly done this for you all and it was just wonderful to see.

Students: You are a tribute to your school and your parents. All the very best as you move onto the next stage of your education. Rgds, SL",Mobile Uploads
1632026600406302_1632028263739469,"Dear All - my thoughts on some sections of the Budget. I haven't covered all of it otherwise this post really would go on for ever, but have focussed on those aspects I believe are particularly important not least as they provide an insight into just how this new Tory government is going to behave.
Some of the Budget I approve of whilst other sections are, to my mind, simply appalling. Read on......
Good Bits:
- a further cut to corporation tax. The private sector have played a blinder since 2010 with over 2m new jobs. This will help keep the engine motoring in the right direction. Increasing the national insurance allowance from £2,000 to £3,000 will also be good for future employment prospects.
- likewise on Apprentiships; the chancellors levy on business to be spent directly on more apprentices is over-due. UKplc has generally relied on central gov to fund apprentices. This levy brings us more into line with Germany and will, hopefully, get co's to be even more pro-active in funding and training apprentices, which can only be a good thing for them and us in the long term.
- the announcement of a new higher 'living' wage is a good idea. It will cause some difficulty in certain low paid sectors but the principle is an excellent one. I hope it succeeds.
- making it harder for non-doms to avoid tax. This sector exploded under New Labour so it's about time people who derive all the advantages of living in the UK with few of the costs, actually contribute a fairer share.
- continuing to raise the personal tax threshold when we start to pay income tax to £11,000. I'm glad to see this Lib Dem policy has become entrenched and is set to continue.
- fixing defence spending at 2%. In today's troubled world this is a necessary step. Albeit I do not believe we need to spend £100bn or so over the next twenty years on a like for like replacement of Trident. I would keep a smaller nuclear deterrent but not the all-singing and dancing (and hugely expensive) package that both the Lab and Tory's propose - ie like for like replacement.
Trident begs the question to me of why is it that throughout history we seem always to be locked into the time-warp of fighting 'previous generations' wars rather than the current challenges we actually face?
Bad Bits:
- cutting the maintenance grant for poorer students who wish to go to university. This is a deeply regressive move and I fear will put off those from low income families. By replacing grants for poorer students from Sept 2016 with loans of up to £8,200 pa - on top of the £9,000 tuition fees - the Conservatives have consigned to the dustbin many decades of positive effort to improve the life chances of youngsters from poorer backgrounds. At current figures this deplorable decision will negatively impact on half a million young people a year! If George Osborne wants to promote fairness then scrapping a grant which enables students from low income families to compete with the middle class and the rich is a bloody funny way to go about it.
- cutting £400m from the Further Education (FE) sector will also make it really tough for the sector over the next four years. Again this is a regressive move as many people from lower income families attend FE Colleges to train up for employment.
- reducing ESA rates for people who are in the work-related group to the same as Jobseekers allowance is a shocking decision. This cohort are often people with disabilities who have been out of work for a long time and are trying to get back into employment. Penalising them for doing so is both cruel and, frankly, dim. Where's the incentive?
- the significant cuts to working tax credit for those on low incomes are absolutely brutal, and I am not exaggerating! Under the treasury's own calculations an out of work family with two children living outside London will lose £6,000 of their annual income. Whilst a couple with the same two children but earning at just under the household median for a town like Eastbourne (£25 - £27k) will be facing a similar savage 10% income reduction. From 2016 they'll be around £2,000 a year worse off. This is desperate stuff and it seems the Tories are clearly intent on penalising the poor; working or otherwise. Why?
- meanwhile raising the inheritance tax threshold to £1m will benefit only a tiny number of people - approx 8%. Compare that to the attack on the millions of people who make up the working poor.
I do wonder how exactly our broader nation benefits from a tax change that makes it easier for the very well off to pass on their wealth to their offspring, whilst at the same time as making it harder for poorer people with children?
- cutting green subsidies. I guess David Cameron's view of us trying to build a sustainable green economy as green crap, has come to fruition!
- a further four year cap on public sector wages of 1% per annum for public sector workers is mean-spirited. Teachers, nurses and the like have borne a lot of the brunt of the austerity programme since 2010 and forcing their wages down in real terms for a another four years is I think unfair. I get a sense it's almost a personal vindictiveness from the Tories against the public sector.
My conclusion of the Budget overall is that if you are of the working poor, disabled, young or work in the frontline of public sector, then the next few years are going to be bleak. If however you are rich or in the upper 50% of income segment, then life's just going to keep getting better.
In short, the Tories - unfettered - are back in power!
Fox Hunting:
On the very same day as the budget was announced it also slipped out that the Tories aim to undermine the Hunting Act with a Statutory Instrument (SI). This is a straightforward technical order in parliament which only allows for 90 minutes debate so it's very unusual to use an SI in this way.
It's obvious to me that the Conservatives are trying to undermine the ban on hunting without going through due process. Robbie Marsland of the League Against Cruel Sports summed it up perfectly: ""By amending the Hunting Act the government are deliberately and cynically making it easier for hunts to chase and kill foxes, and harder for them to be convicted when they break the law"". Enough said.
That's it folks. Sorry it's such a long post and for those of you who have persevered to the end I hope you found it interesting. We certainly know what we are in for over the next few years. Rgds, SL

382118358091_10155428774648092,"My Answers to Abingdon Facebook Hustings:

1. How will you tackle Abingdon’s traffic issues? How will you encourage more residents to walk, cycle, car share or take the bus?

This is the top issue that comes up on the doorsteps across Abingdon. This question is right to point out it’s not all about the A34. One of the great unknown killers is air pollution and we need to do everything we can to transition to greener, more sustainable forms of transport. 

I have been a longstanding supporter of cycling and endorse the ‘Get Britain Cycling’ report created by the Cross Party Parliamentary Committee for cycling. I’d also like to sit on this committee as an MP. It makes the point that local planners need to build in walking and cycling into local plans first and not as an afterthought. Just look at the debacle that are the cycle lanes near the Wootton Rd roundabout forcing bikes to cycle in the road just at the point where it is most dangerous. I also support for the OCN strategic cycle network proposal and would look for funding opportunities to ensure routes link up for all.

We need to encourage more people into buses. They are the primary transport of young people, the elderly and the vulnerable and it is a travesty that so many local bus routes have closed. We are proposing a young persons’ bus pass that gives them 2/3 off bus travel and are committed to keeping bus passes for over 65s. They are good for the economy and good for the environment. I would work with local councillors to identify the most needed routes. For example it is madness that there is no direct bus route to Oxford Station anymore. I would press for that. In the Lib Dem manifesto it says we will halt the decline in bus services and carry out a review of bus funding and bus policies. We will give principal local authorities the power to run, commission, and regulate the bus network in their area.

2. Our schools are badly affected by both the existing and proposed funding formula. What will you do to ensure our schools get more funding and not less?

I am a teacher and a primary school governor and have seen first-hand what the reduction in education funding has done to our budgets. Schools are doing everything we can to protect students from these cuts and as the MP I would fight against them. I have signed a pledge to do so and support groups like Oxfordshire Fairer Funding who are raising the issue. If the Tory plans go through, we stand to lose 9 teachers from John Mason, 9 teachers from Fitzharrys and 7 from Larkmead. All primary schools will be badly affected. To reverse the cuts, we are committed to a £7bn cash injection for schools and then to safeguard per pupil spending in real terms after that. We have also said that under the NFF no school should lose out and have earmarked funding to make sure of this.

3.What are your plans to ensure people get an appointment with their GP in a timely manner?

The NHS is under enormous strain and there is a projected deficit of £30bn by 2020; £8bn for the immediate hole and a further £22bn of ‘efficiency savings’ to be found by the local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs; ours is Oxfordshire). By ‘efficiency savings’, that of course mean cuts. Liberal Democrats have been very honest with people; if we want a fully functioning NHS we need to find the money from somewhere, so we are proposing a penny on the pound on income tax. This will raise £6bn/year to be spend on the NHS, Social Care and mental health services.

We need more doctors surgeries, especially in the areas where there will be housing developments. Again, I would like to see this guaranteed before building starts. While I am supportive of skype appointments and surgeries working in groups to ensure longer access hours, we also have a doctor and nurse recruitment and retention problem. Without them how can we deliver this vision? The spectre of Brexit and the Government’s insistence of not safeguarding EU citizens’ rights mean we are facing a workforce crisis as well as a funding crisis. We have seen over nurses leave the profession in record numbers and 10% of GPs are EU citizens. We would reinstate the nursing bursaries now to encourage more people to join the profession and we must guarantee EU citizens’ rights now, not in two weeks, not in two months or year, but now, to make sure we have the staff we need to run a first class NHS.

Lastly, I am deeply worried by the consequences of the ‘Oxfordshire Transformation Plan’ but forward by OCCG. This plan is designed to bring more care into the community, which I agree with, but it is also the primary mechanism to deliver the £22bn of cuts (in Oxfordshire that is £176m). As it stands there is not enough money to ensure the care is in the community first and so all they seem to be are an excuse to reduce services. This plan is happening in two stages. Stage 1 saw reduction of acute beds at the John Radcliffe and a downgrading of services at the Horton in Banbury. GPs surgeries and community hospitals are part of Phase 2. I have sought assurance from OCCG that this will not mean reduction of services at Abingdon Community Hospital but they cannot assure that so I have started a campaign to ensure the profile of this issue is raised and as an MP I would fight against any reduction in services like in patient-beds which look the most likely thing to go first.

4.What will you do to help stimulate retail economy in Abingdon?

Abingdon is a beautiful market town but more and more people are enticed to go shopping in Didcot or Oxford. The town needs proper investment. 

Above all, we need the Conservative-run Vale to deliver the long-promised Charter Redevelopment.  They have repeatedly promised that it is on the way, but have, so far, failed to deliver. If elected, I will press the Conservatives hard to deliver on their promises.

In policy terms there are three key issues: business rate relief for small firms, increasing footfall and protecting the local economy. 

It is the first rule of business that if you cannot be profitable, you will not be able to survive. So, to have more shops we need to increase footfall and review business rates to make sure small independent shops, especially, are given a leg up. With the general election just a few days away, the Conservatives have still not told small firms if they will receive business rates relief - despite promises by Sajid Javid that he would confirm details before the general election. The Liberal Democrats would review business rates to reduce burdens on small firms, and make small and medium-sized businesses the priority for any future business rate cuts.

We also know people are put off coming to Abingdon because of the traffic. I’ve covered this in the first question, so refer you to that. But we also need to make sure that people have other reasons to come into town e.g. improving library and day services to encourage people into the centre. We can only do this with proper funding of local councils. In recent years we have seen more and more cuts. The closing of the Children's Centres are a direct consequence of this. We want to establish a government process to deliver greater devolution of financial responsibility to local authorities, building on the work of the Independent Commission on Local Government Finance. Any changes must balance the objectives of more local autonomy and fair equalisation between communities, but this should also mean they have more power to do what is right for our area.

And finally we need to protect the economy. I will talk about science in the next question, but it is no joke that 1000 Abingdon jobs are at risk by the unnecessary decision to pull out of Euratom. But more than this, BMW have said that they are worried for their future in Oxford and many people who live in Abingdon work for them. Then there are the universities who don’t just employ professors but also catering staff and cleaners. The risk of the hard Brexit that the Conservatives are proposing is a real threat to Abingdon’s local economy. This is why the Liberal Democrats will be making the case for staying in the single market and the customs union as this is the only way to make sure that these vital businesses do not leave and leave us poorer for it.

5. What do you believe government can do to minimise job losses in engineering and science as we leave the EU?

I’m especially passionate about this, being a Physics teacher. Britain is a leading light in science. We are the only Party to have a specific section on science in our manifesto and I would encourage you to look at it. We are committed to not just protecting the science budget but to eventually doubling it. 

But Brexit looms. We need to underwrite funding for Horizon2020 and Marie Curie grants, worth over £80m alone to Oxford University, as a matter of urgency. We are already seeing a brain drain from local scientific businesses too due to the EU citizens issue. The best and brightest are the first to leave and if it is harder to be given research grants based in the UK, or your job is uncertain, it is no surprise we are seeing this exodus already. It is the end of the school year and families are deciding what to do. Again, the lack of action on the part of the Government is having direct local consequences. We need to guarantee it now. We also need to be aware that many patents are currently granted under EU licensing. These are important to ensure innovation is protected for companies. The EU are willing to keep us a part of the patent unitary but we would need to accept being part of the European Court of Justice. This is why we are calling to stay a part of the ECJ. The court is not part of the EU, but it does oversee all treaties between European countries. It is a nonsense to leave this as any trade agreement with the EU or any EU country would still lie in its jurisdiction. We lose our judges who sit on the ECJ, making it even less likely to go in our favour.

On Euratom, the treaty that governs the purchase, transport and disposal of nuclear materials is also overseen by the ECJ. We need to be clear, we did NOT have to leave. It is in the manifesto that we are committed to staying a member and we supported amendments to protect this. The position the government has taken is just that, a position, and legal minds dispute it. They claim that section 106a of the Euratom Treaty inextricably links the Treaty to the EU. But, the two entities remain legally distinct. So rather than dive headlong into this damaging position I would rather have delayed this decision until it has been tested in the courts. Meanwhile, that would have bought us time to either negotiate an amendment or associate membership. As the MP I would have voted against the specific amendment to leave and will continue to fight for this. If you want to read more see my article on it here: http://www.libdemvoice.org/science-at-risk-brexit-and-the-dangers-to-britains-nuclear-industry-54190.html

6. How will you ensure that the diamond interchange is completed in north Abingdon?

I have campaigned vigorously with my fellow Lib Dems to ensure that the funding for the Lodge Hill junction is 100% secured before the 950+ homes are built in North Abingdon. Lodge Hill is desperately needed to reduce congestion in Abingdon town centre, Dunmore Road, Marcham Road and to prevent further deterioration of air quality in the town. As the MP I will fight for this and speak against any development unless the Lodge Hill slips are guaranteed. I would also work with local councillors to reinstate Lodge Hill as part of the Local Infrastructure Plan after the Conservatives took it out. This is also another example of the Conservatives running the Vale breaking their promises.  At the last election they claimed that they had the finance in place to ‘front fund’ the Lodge Hill interchange.

If you elect me as your MP I will push the Vale to deliver on this promise too.

In our manifesto, we have also proposed a £100bn capital investment fund for major infrastructure. This would not only stimulate jobs and the economy, but part of it would also be devolved to local authorities to be able to make decisions about what is best for communities. 

We are sick of the broken promises and platitudes on this issue and it is time we had a proper solution.

The Tories on Abingdon Town Council should be ashamed of themselves. Last week the Lib Dem group proposed a motion to fly a rainbow flag in Abingdon in solidarity with Oxford Pride. At a time of great social division one would think this would be small, positive gesture reinforcing the fact that Abingdon is a tolerant place that celebrates diversity. In 2016, this should not have been a contentious issue. Yet, unbelievably, the Conservatives votes down the motion 7 votes to 6. Why? Surely such a gesture transcends party politics. The message this sends to the LGBT+ and wider community is damaging to the image of Abingdon. A petition of over 800 people has already been signed and Pink News has criticised the move nationally. I call on the Conservatives to think again. If they want, they could propose their own motion, verbatim. I am sure the Lib Dems would back it. Abingdon deserves better representation than this.
