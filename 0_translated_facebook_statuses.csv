#transport #publicservices #access #buses #local 

I have written to Transport for London (TfL) over the unresolved issues surrounding the 110 bus route.

A number of local residents over a number of years, including a previous petition of over 1500 signatures, have asked for the 110 bus route to serve Whitton high street. At present local people living in the Woodlawn estate or nearby roads wanting to access their nearest shopping centre must change buses if they want to access the high street.

The heart of Whitton is its high street for people living in the Woodlawn estate, and nearby roads. With a small amount of rejigging the 110 bus would get local people, many of whom are disabled or elderly, to shops with a minimum amount of difficulty. Instead people have to change buses to get to the local shopping centre even though diverting the current route adds a few minutes to the journey. 

I'm asking for a meeting with Transport for London officers to see if this long standing issue can be resolved.

This is not an issue that is going to go away. I think it would be helpful if TfL could review their position and sit down with myself and local councillors to see if this issue can be resolved for the benefit of residents especially those with mobility issues who find it difficult to access shops and services on Whitton high street.

Local residents have also raised similar issues during the recent pre-planning community forum discussions with the new college site by the A316. A new service could link up the college site with the Dene Estate, Counties Estate and then up into Whitton.

Our local councillor Liz Jaeger said: ""Another idea that has been suggested to TfL, and would resolve this issue, is a circular route from Twickenham Station, running down the A316 to serve the new college developments, and returning back through Whitton. This would link several poorly served housing estates with Whitton town centre."", pronunciation=I urge TfL to ensure 110 bus route serves Whitton High Street.

With a small amount of rejigging the 110 bus would get local people, many of whom are disabled or elderly, to shops with a minimum amount of difficulty. Instead people have to change buses to get to the local shopping centre even though diverting the current route adds a few minutes to the journey. 

I'm asking for a meeting with Transport for London officers to see if this long standing issue can be resolved.

This is not an issue that is going to go away. I think it would be helpful if TfL could review their position and sit down with myself and local councillors to see if this issue can be resolved for the benefit of residents especially those with mobility issues who find it difficult to access shops and services on Whitton high street.

Local residents have also raised similar issues during the recent pre-planning community forum discussions with the new college site by the A316. A new service could link up the college site with the Dene Estate, Counties Estate and then up into Whitton.

Our local councillor Liz Jaeger said: ""Another idea that has been suggested to TfL, and would resolve this issue, is a circular route from Twickenham Station, running down the A316 to serve the new college developments, and returning back through Whitton. This would link several poorly served housing estates with Whitton town centre."")",Timeline Photos

Here's an advanced peak at one of the most important topics raised in the Q and A with me on the party leadership in the next edition of Liberator Magazine - liberatormagazine.org.uk.

Q. What policies should the party put forward in the next manifesto to address the intergenerational divide and how should it propose to tax the wealth of rich people and corporations?

A. Generational inequity represents a great social injustice. Young people seek the same standards of living and the same opportunities as older generations and can rightfully feel cheated when they do not get it. Young people were amongst the worst affected by the economic downturn – and will suffer more from the impacts of Brexit, limiting their aspirations and harming their future. 

Tackling generational inequity must be an important element in our programme. For too many, the dream of owning a home remains just a dream because the country has not built enough houses. The rental market is weighted against tenants. We must address both. I agreed with the policies in our manifesto to reverse housing benefit cuts and to raise the minimum wage for young people, but this is only a start. I aim to work through the Federal Policy Committee and the membership at least to focus on this area as a matter of urgency. 

On wealth inequality, I opposed the Conservatives’ tax cuts for the rich, for example through inheritance tax. As a minister, I pressed for action against corporate tax avoidance and evasion. The sums of tax avoided by some large companies is a scandal that must be addressed. A liberal society is one in which everyone makes a fair contribution. We are still a long way from that., pronunciation=A GREAT SOCIAL INJUSTICE

Since declaring my intention to stand for the Liberal Democrat leadership I have been overwhelmed by messages of support. In the strong liberal tradition I have also received a great many questions about my vision for the country and the party. The first and most immediate issue on all our minds is the UK’s future relationship with the European Union, and I therefore welcome the very direct questions from party members on this subject.  

I am proud to be a member of the Liberal Democrats, the most internationalist of parties, and I wholly subscribe to the statement of beliefs set out in the preamble to the party constitution, including our commitment to ‘fight poverty, oppression, hunger, ignorance, disease and aggression wherever they occur and to promote the free movement of ideas, people, goods and services’. 
I possess liberal views on immigration and its economic and cultural benefits. I married into an Asian family and have a Slovak daughter-in-law and I have spent much of my life battling anti-immigrant prejudice. 

I have been a supporter of the European project and Britain’s role in it for over half a century. I was and am a Remainer. I support and promote our party’s policy of a referendum at the end of the Brexit process on the terms of the deal as finally negotiated, including the option of remaining within the EU – an option which I strongly endorse and would campaign for.  

I specifically support the aims of the single market and its four freedoms – the free movement of goods, capital, services, and labour. I spent five years in government as Business Secretary evangelising for it, and on the 29th of June, at the end of the debate on the Queen’s Speech, I voted with all my Liberal Democrat colleagues and 90 members of other parties to keep Britain a full member of it. If Brexit is to go ahead, maintaining membership of the single market should be our negotiating objective – a position which we must champion as Labour betrays, once again, its Remain supporters. 

I am not, however, a free market fundamentalist; I believe that the four freedoms must take account of wider social concerns at the national level. I believe, for example, that while the freedom of movement of capital can be beneficial, it must be constrained – a position which the party has long supported. I worked, for example, with Emmanuel Macron, when he was my opposite number, to restrict the ease of corporate take-overs. 

I believe in free trade, but I worked in government to stop a narrow interpretation of EU public procurement rules, in order to enable supply chain factors – such as local sourcing – to be promoted within the UK’s industrial strategy.  

I have observed that other member states impose restrictions on free movement. Germany, for example, restricts the free movement of professional staff. It seems entirely reasonable to look at ways through which the UK can remain within the single market – and, I hope, the European Union –  but manages migration in a way that better deals with some of the real social impacts on local communities. I have suggested a variety of options, including restricting admission to those with jobs to come to. The failure to consider reforms of this kind may well have contributed to the Brexit vote. 

I believe that Brexit would be a disaster for Britain, but we have to recognise that we lost the vote last year. If we can help to prevent it, even at this late stage, by looking in an open-minded way at reforms such as these, it seems to me that the prize is worth the effort.  

One final point: one of the great strengths of the party I hope to lead is that its policy is set through discussion and debate to which any party member can contribute – not imposed from the top down like the Conservatives or, increasingly, Labour. The leader has the right, and the duty, to put forward his or her views and to debate them with party members in an open and positive way, but at the end of the day it is the party, not the leader, which decides our policy – and that is entirely right., pronunciation=BREXIT

I am proud to be a member of the Liberal Democrats, the most internationalist of parties, and I wholly subscribe to the statement of beliefs set out in the preamble to the party constitution, including our commitment to ‘fight poverty, oppression, hunger, ignorance, disease and aggression wherever they occur and to promote the free movement of ideas, people, goods and services’. 
I possess liberal views on immigration and its economic and cultural benefits. I married into an Asian family and have a Slovak daughter-in-law and I have spent much of my life battling anti-immigrant prejudice. 

I have been a supporter of the European project and Britain’s role in it for over half a century. I was and am a Remainer. I support and promote our party’s policy of a referendum at the end of the Brexit process on the terms of the deal as finally negotiated, including the option of remaining within the EU – an option which I strongly endorse and would campaign for.  

I specifically support the aims of the single market and its four freedoms – the free movement of goods, capital, services, and labour. I spent five years in government as Business Secretary evangelising for it, and on the 29th of June, at the end of the debate on the Queen’s Speech, I voted with all my Liberal Democrat colleagues and 90 members of other parties to keep Britain a full member of it. If Brexit is to go ahead, maintaining membership of the single market should be our negotiating objective – a position which we must champion as Labour betrays, once again, its Remain supporters. 

I am not, however, a free market fundamentalist; I believe that the four freedoms must take account of wider social concerns at the national level. I believe, for example, that while the freedom of movement of capital can be beneficial, it must be constrained – a position which the party has long supported. I worked, for example, with Emmanuel Macron, when he was my opposite number, to restrict the ease of corporate take-overs. 

I believe in free trade, but I worked in government to stop a narrow interpretation of EU public procurement rules, in order to enable supply chain factors – such as local sourcing – to be promoted within the UK’s industrial strategy.  

I have observed that other member states impose restrictions on free movement. Germany, for example, restricts the free movement of professional staff. It seems entirely reasonable to look at ways through which the UK can remain within the single market – and, I hope, the European Union –  but manages migration in a way that better deals with some of the real social impacts on local communities. I have suggested a variety of options, including restricting admission to those with jobs to come to. The failure to consider reforms of this kind may well have contributed to the Brexit vote. 

I believe that Brexit would be a disaster for Britain, but we have to recognise that we lost the vote last year. If we can help to prevent it, even at this late stage, by looking in an open-minded way at reforms such as these, it seems to me that the prize is worth the effort.  

One final point: one of the great strengths of the party I hope to lead is that its policy is set through discussion and debate to which any party member can contribute – not imposed from the top down like the Conservatives or, increasingly, Labour. The leader has the right, and the duty, to put forward his or her views and to debate them with party members in an open and positive way, but at the end of the day it is the party, not the leader, which decides our policy – and that is entirely right.)",

The owners of the much valued Peter’s flower stall outside Twickenham station should not be driven off Twickenham high street is the clear message that Vince Cable has sent to both Richmond Council and to the developers of Twickenham station.
 
At present the longstanding flower stall business  is threatened due to the company Solum, who are the developers of Twickenham train station, giving the owner of the flower staff  sudden notice only last Wednesday that the stall can no longer operate from its current location from this coming Friday.
 
Vince has already intervened on the behalf of the flower stall owner, contacting both Richmond Council and the company Solum.
 
Vince is urging Solum to give Peter’s flower stall greater time to find an alternative location and has suggested to Richmond Council that an alternative location on Twickenham high street is offered to Peter’s flower stall, such as the apparent licenced space for a trader next to Waitrose.
 
Vince said:
 
“This is a much valued flower stall, which I have personally used many times. It is these type of long standing businesses which make Twickenham such a special place.
 
“No one should be given just six working days’ notice that their business has to stop trading. That is blatantly unfair for any trader.”

Oct 2 is a big day for social housing.  Housing Associations have been given this deadline to respond to proposals for a voluntary ‘right to buy’ scheme so as to forestall legislation.

The original draft legislation was a body blow to social housing.  It would further deplete the stock of affordable property let on the basis of need.  All previous experience of right -to -buy is that stock sold is not replaced on anything like a  one-for-one basis.  At a time when public finance is still under pressure one segment of the population would be given a substantial subsidy for purchase.  This subsidy for owner occupation is yet another,  coming on top of ‘Help to Buy’, Osborne’s extraordinarily expensive boost to demand and house prices. 

 Moreover the legislation undermines the operational independence of Associations which are, mostly, charitable bodies, not an arm of the state.  And one certain consequence would be that sitting tenants would buy and then, in due course, either sell on or rent on a buy-to-let basis; just when evidence is emerging that the buy-to-let sector is a potentially serious threat to the financial stability of the banking sector.

The legislation is pure dogma without a shred of economic, social or moral justification. If, as my former colleague Greg Clarke claims, the aim is to support the aspiration of social tenants to home ownership then the discount could be given to them to buy on the open market, without depleting the social housing stock (still a bad idea, but less destructive).

The government has however panicked at the prospect of solid opposition in parliament and possible derailment in the Lords.  It has offered a voluntary agreement which maintains a presumption to sell but leaves discretion over what to sell with the Associations with freedom also over how to replace the  sold stock.  There are various other safeguards, such as protecting rural associations. 

Some will argue that the voluntary agreement concedes too much to the government and that the legislation could and should be weakened through legal action or by diluting the Bill or both.  Much hinges on the trust the sector has in David Orr, its spokesman and CEO of the National Housing Federation.  

If there is one true disaster area for government policy it is in the housing sector.  Retreat on this particular proposal is a necessary step forward., pronunciation=5 Days to Save Social Housing

I support an immediate guaranteed right to live and work in the UK for all EU citizens working in NHS and care services. Those working tirelessly to keep the citizens of the UK healthy deserve to have certainty in their future.

I have just met a representative from Sutton and East Surrey Water at Carshalton Ponds so he could explain to me what the problem is and how it is going to be resolved.
The position is that Sutton & East Surrey Water maintain the level of Carshalton Ponds by pumping water up from Mitcham. This water is normally pumped into the top pond. The water level in the ponds is supplemented by groundwater. 

Unfortunately, groundwater levels are low as a result of a lack of rainfall. Coupled with this problem there is degradation of the walls of the ponds, leading to leakage which will have affected the water levels. It is the Council’s responsibility to repair the Ponds’ walls and this is scheduled to start on Wednesday if water levels have dropped sufficiently. No water is now being pumped into the top ponds so water levels drop to facilitate these essential repairs.

Sutton & East Surrey Water’s licence for pumping water does not allow them to pump a limitless amount into the Ponds and they have to maintain water levels from below the waterfall into the River Wandle. The licence is managed by the Environment Agency. Sutton & East Surrey Water will be in breach of their licence if they take more water. According to Sutton & East Surrey Water, the Environment Agency are unwilling to extend the licence for fear it will have a detrimental impact on the length of the River Wandle which they consider to have a higher environmental need. I have made them aware that people are reporting dead fish in the Ponds.

Once the repairs are complete, Sutton & East Surrey will re-supply the Ponds and, providing there are no further leakages, they will continue to pump a substantial volume of water into the Ponds: more than 1 million litres a day.

I will be seeking a meeting with Sutton Council to clarify what long-term action can be taken to ensure the Ponds remain watertight in the future., pronunciation=Many of you have expressed concern about the state of Carshalton Ponds.

Brexit was the first blow to business, they are imposing more and more burdens on business. The Government have issued a consultation on the revaluation of business rates, in which one in four businesses will have significantly higher rates. The rates for the biggest firms will increase by up to 45%. Since May 2015, the underlying data for our economy indicates it is weakening, with the service sector showing no growth and the construction sector shrinking in 3 of the last 4 quarters. 

When considering Brexit, a majority of business, of all sizes, support remaining in the EU as being best for their business, jobs and the economy as a whole. With the decision to opt for a “Hard Brexit,” the pound has fallen even further against other currencies. Further, a Hard Brexit, and reliance on WTO rules, would mean that the EU would legally have to impose tariffs on the UK including an average tariff across all goods of 5.8%. That means our goods would be more expensive abroad.

There was a representative from both Southern Rail and Govia Thameslink as well as the Sutton train station manager. Here are some of the issues discussed:

The dispute over driver-only operated trains and the shortage of drivers is the main source of disruption in recent months, combined with problems with Network Rail’s projects and infrastructure like London Bridge station, trackside fires, signalling faults and a sinkhole!
 
The shortage of drivers is being dealt with by training new staff. However it takes 18 months to train the staff and therefore it will take a while to make any difference. The first batch of newly trained drivers are just finishing their training.

The works at London Bridge have been an issue for some time and will continue to be so until 2018 when 24 trains an hour should be able to run through the station.

Compensation was discussed at length both generally and the difficulty in getting it. In addition there were issues raised about contactless compensation.

There is very poor provision of information when disruption occurs which is the fault of both Network Rail and Southern Rail. When platform numbers for trains are changed at the last minute this is a signaller’s decision. There also needs to be greater constituency and timeliness with the information being broadcast on different media platforms i.e the app, website and station broadcasts all need to be saying the same thing.

Finally a decision is imminent about whether the emergency timetable will have to be rolled out for a further 4 weeks.

This is a great way to encourage healthy eating and I’m hoping the residents of Sutton found this project a useful way to have a more healthy diet.)",Timeline Photos

Could you confirm that your decision not to ask the rich to pay a penny more in tax means that the Conservatives will have to cut public services by an extra 6.6%, on top of your existing plans to deal with the deficit to pay for your unfunded tax cuts?
 
Under your plans, every unprotected government department will have their budgets cut beyond what is necessary to simply balance the books, thanks to your ideological drive to shrink the state to levels not seen since the 1960s.
 
That will include the Ministry of Defence, where you will need to let 25,000 military personnel go in order to deliver the savings needed to pay for your tax cuts. As Danny Alexander said today, the consequence of your desire to cut departmental spending beyond what is necessary to balance the books means it will be ‘almost impossible’ for you to meet the Nato commitment to spend 2% of GDP on our Armed Forces.
 
George, you can’t have it both ways. So what’s more important to you – an unfunded tax cut for the rich or meeting your obligations on defence?
 
Yours Sincerely,
 
Lord Scriven
Liberal Democrat Campaign Spokesperson, pronunciation=Recently Lib Dem Lord Scriven sent the following letter to George Osborne regarding defence spending:

Only one will be developed.  Please visit tfl.gov.uk/fiveways-croydon to see details of the proposals and to have your say. The deadline for comments is 15 March 2015.

The two proposals are:
A road, cycle and pedestrian bridge connecting the A232 between Croydon Road and Duppas Hill Road
Widening the A23 where it crosses the railway by Waddon station and making Epsom Road wider to accommodate two-way traffic

Both proposals would change the road layout and the look of some streets in the area. Both would also improve facilities for other road users by providing new cycle lanes, more accessible pedestrian crossings and improving bus services. The proposals would help to meet a likely increase in traffic, caused by growth in the local economy and population, by reducing congestion and improving journey time reliability. TfL want to make the roads included in the scheme safer, more accessible and more pleasant for all road users.

The Co-op are also talking to Transport for London, about an Oyster card terminal for their Mollison Drive branch.
 
I welcome the Co-op’s willingness, if they close the Post Office, to provide at least some of the services that the Post Office provided within their store. This will help residents.
 
But this will not make up for the loss of all Post Office services. So we are continuing to campaign to keep the Post Office open, as well as pursuing options for re-locating the Post Office elsewhere on Roundshaw should the Coop push the closure through.

There are two things going on. Yes, I voted to keep the spare room subsidy but I am also supporting a Bill to make it fairer.
 
In April 2013, the Government introduced an under-occupancy penalty to encourage more effective use of social housing. Labour had already introduced rules to stop people receiving housing benefit to support them in rented private sector properties that were larger than they needed.
 
Action was needed because:
·  There are 1.7 million households waiting for housing in the social rented sector and 240,000 households already in the social rented sector are overcrowded.
·  There are almost 1 million spare rooms being paid for by Housing Benefit for working-age, social rented sector tenants, which isn’t affordable when others are living in overcrowded accommodation.
 
On 15th July 2014, the Department for Work and Pensions  (DWP) published a report, which the Liberal Democrats in Government had pressed for, looking at the implementation of the removal of the spare room subsidy over its first six months. The report raised several concerns including that only a small percentage of affected claimants had downsized and that tenants affected were making cuts to household essentials and incurring debts, with 57% of claimants reporting they were cutting back on what they deemed household essentials.
 
Having considered the findings of the DWP review, my Liberal Democrat colleagues and I took action earlier this year to make the policy fairer for vulnerable people.
 
Andrew George, Liberal Democrat MP, published an Affordable Homes Bill.  He is seeking to amend the law in relation to the spare room subsidy and to create new tools to improve the ability of local communities to meet their needs for affordable homes. His Bill reflected Liberal Democrat views, having reviewed the DWP report, that the rules should be changed to protect permanently the most vulnerable and ensure that existing tenants aren't penalised when they cannot move into smaller accommodation.
 
Andrew George’s Bill, which I supported at Second Reading, has now gone into committee to be considered in detail. I support his Bill but do not support the complete removal of the spare room subsidy.
 
Andrew George’s Bill, if it becomes law, will mean claimants will only pay the under occupancy charge if they had refused a reasonable offer of alternative accommodation. This change will apply only to tenants who signed leases prior to April 2013 (when the removal of the spare room subsidy started). We will continue applying the existing rules to new tenants, but existing tenants who are ‘under occupying’ will not have their housing benefit cut, unless they have been made at least one reasonable offer of alternative social rented accommodation with the correct number of bedrooms., pronunciation=In the last week I've received a number of queries about why I voted for the Spare Room Subsidy/Bedroom Tax Bill.

166841220058437_741787365897150,"Translated(src=en, dest=en, text=Recently I’ve received quite a few concerns regarding EDM 454 and the pensions’ scheme for firefighters.

As a member of the party that introduced the state pension for the first time way back in 1908, I know how important it is to protect people from poverty in old age. Firefighters provide the British public with a vitally important service and consistently put themselves in danger in order to protect us. I fully appreciate that the physical stresses of doing this require a careful evaluation of what constitutes a fair and reasonable pension age. With people living longer, though, I think it is vital that government does look again at how we deliver the changes that are needed to ensure that pensions remain sustainable and affordable for the long term. The key is to strike the right balance.

After two years of negotiations and changes, firefighters will still get one of the most generous public service pensions available - £26,000 a year after a full career, including the £7,000 state pension. 

Someone in the private sector would have to contribute twice as much to get the same pension. The changes to firefighters' pensions will see firefighters treated in the same way as the army and police, similarly physical occupations.

The Medical Director of Working Fit was commissioned to review the Normal Pension Age (NPA) as part of the fire service reforms. His report found that the majority of firefighters can work until age 60, provided they are sufficiently fit when recruited, maintain a healthy lifestyle and undertake a similar level of fitness training to that which is recommended to members of the general public. The report also found that women were also able to serve until age 60, provided they too were recruited at the right levels of fitness.

Dr Williams concluded that even for firefighters who do lose fitness, the vast majority are able to regain their fitness levels following remedial training. If a firefighter is unfit due to a qualifying medical reason, then they are eligible for ill-health retirement. Operational and staffing matters are left to each fire and rescue authority to manage, including providing redeployment opportunities where they are able to do so.

In May 2012 the Government published a Proposed Final Agreement on reforms to the Firefighters' Pension Schemes in England. After further detailed discussions, this offer was revised in June. This new offer included lower employee pension contributions from 2015, a better pension for firefighters retiring from age 55, and a Joint Working Group to look at the FBU's concerns on fitness management.

No one will be forced to work longer and firefighters will still be able to retire from age 55 with a fair pension. A greater proportion of firefighters are protected from pension reform changes than any other large public service workforce and it is worth noting that one in three firefighters already have a retirement age of 60 due to the pension scheme changes implemented in 2006. 60 was also the original NPA, set in the fire service in 1925. In addition, an independent review found that, based on current practices, 100 per cent of firefighters who remain physically active will still be operational at age 60.

I hope it is helpful in setting out my position on this issue., pronunciation=Recently I’ve received quite a few concerns regarding EDM 454 and the pensions’ scheme for firefighters.

As a member of the party that introduced the state pension for the first time way back in 1908, I know how important it is to protect people from poverty in old age. Firefighters provide the British public with a vitally important service and consistently put themselves in danger in order to protect us. I fully appreciate that the physical stresses of doing this require a careful evaluation of what constitutes a fair and reasonable pension age. With people living longer, though, I think it is vital that government does look again at how we deliver the changes that are needed to ensure that pensions remain sustainable and affordable for the long term. The key is to strike the right balance.

After two years of negotiations and changes, firefighters will still get one of the most generous public service pensions available - £26,000 a year after a full career, including the £7,000 state pension. 

Someone in the private sector would have to contribute twice as much to get the same pension. The changes to firefighters' pensions will see firefighters treated in the same way as the army and police, similarly physical occupations.

The Medical Director of Working Fit was commissioned to review the Normal Pension Age (NPA) as part of the fire service reforms. His report found that the majority of firefighters can work until age 60, provided they are sufficiently fit when recruited, maintain a healthy lifestyle and undertake a similar level of fitness training to that which is recommended to members of the general public. The report also found that women were also able to serve until age 60, provided they too were recruited at the right levels of fitness.

Dr Williams concluded that even for firefighters who do lose fitness, the vast majority are able to regain their fitness levels following remedial training. If a firefighter is unfit due to a qualifying medical reason, then they are eligible for ill-health retirement. Operational and staffing matters are left to each fire and rescue authority to manage, including providing redeployment opportunities where they are able to do so.

In May 2012 the Government published a Proposed Final Agreement on reforms to the Firefighters' Pension Schemes in England. After further detailed discussions, this offer was revised in June. This new offer included lower employee pension contributions from 2015, a better pension for firefighters retiring from age 55, and a Joint Working Group to look at the FBU's concerns on fitness management.

No one will be forced to work longer and firefighters will still be able to retire from age 55 with a fair pension. A greater proportion of firefighters are protected from pension reform changes than any other large public service workforce and it is worth noting that one in three firefighters already have a retirement age of 60 due to the pension scheme changes implemented in 2006. 60 was also the original NPA, set in the fire service in 1925. In addition, an independent review found that, based on current practices, 100 per cent of firefighters who remain physically active will still be operational at age 60.

Many women who expected to retire at 60 discovered the changes to pensionable age too late to make changes to their retirement plans to take into account the extra years they would have to wait.

Ms Jardine, who is one of the sponsors of a bill presented to Parliament by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Pension Inequality Suffered by women born in the 1950s, said:

“I want to make sure that we have as much evidence as possible of just how much hardship has been caused by the way these changes were made.

“It’s heartbreaking to hear what women who have worked all their lives and planned for their retirement have been put through simply because they weren’t warned about what was about to happen.

“Some, who had expected to have retired and getting their state pension by now, had to take on extra part time jobs just to get by or to stop eating into their savings.

“It’s simply unfair, and it’s up to the rest of us to make sure these women get the justice they deserve.

Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie today said that Richard Lochhead and Nicola Sturgeon owe every farmer in Scotland an apology over the Common Agricultural Payment (CAP) shambles.

Mr Rennie was speaking as he toured a farm near Cupar in Fife. Figures provided by the NFUS have revealed that more than 80% of farmers eligible for an emergency payment have not received any money from the Scottish Government’s emergency National Basic Payment Support Scheme.

The emergency scheme was opened several weeks ago after repeated delays in CAP payments as a result of the failure of an £178m SNP-commissioned IT system.

Commenting, Mr Rennie said:

“Weeks after the launch of the 'emergency' payments scheme, the NFUS say just 19% of farmers eligible for financial support have received any money at all.

“Our rural communities are facing massive economic difficulties as a result of the SNP’s CAP shambles. The response from the SNP seems to lack any sense of urgency at all. Every day that farmers are left waiting for payments is a slap in the face to Scotland’s agricultural sector. Richard Lochhead and Nicola Sturgeon owe every farmer in Scotland an apology over this mess.

“Scotland’s food and drink sector cannot be the best if we do not support our farmers. Liberal Democrats will ensure that more resources are set aside for CAP payments in future to ensure that there is no repeat of the mess we have seen this time round. We have also set out plans to recompense farmers who have faced bank charges as a result of the failure of the SNP government to do their job. That is the right thing to do.”

Liberal Democrats will ensure that more resources are set aside for CAP payments in future to ensure that there is no repeat of the mess we have seen this time round. We have also set out plans to recompense farmers who have faced bank charges as a result of the failure of the SNP government to do their job. That is the right thing to do.”

Aberdeenshire East Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine has called for a cut in VAT for hotels and tourism businesses to help attract visitors to the North East and bolster our economy.

Ms. Jardine claims businesses here could benefit from Lib Dem proposals, agreed at the federal conference last week, to use the regulations to cut the rate to just 5 per cent instead of 20 per cent.

In a speech on the issue she told delegates that tourism is ""the lifeblood of the local economy"" in many areas.

Ms Jardine explained: ""Many of those businesses - especially in rural areas - are family run hotels and small enterprises which provide vital, sometimes the only jobs, in the community.

""They are both the hub of the community and an economic lifeline.

""Some of them might grow into groups like the Macdonald Hotels,  who are huge contributors to the economies of the Highlands, Aberdeenshire, the Borders and elsewhere.

Miriam Gonzalez Durantez: Salmond is campaigning only for his own ego

Voters in Gordon face a choice between a hard-working mother and a man campaigning only for his own ego, Miriam Gonzalez Durantez said today.
The wife of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was on a visit to the constituency, where she met candidate Christine Jardine, who has pledged to set up a new mentoring and support network for young aspiring businesswomen if elected next week.
Ms Gonzalez and Ms Jardine toured the Elevator social enterprise centre in Bridge of Don, Aberdeen, and then addressed a gathering of businesswomen.
Ms Gonzalez praised Ms Jardine's idea and then urged the audience to lend their political support next week to help bring it to fruition.
She said: ""The choice is between Christine and Alex Salmond and there could not be any clearer contrast...Christine is a hard-working mum who lives in the constituency.
""The alternative is someone who is in this election only for himself and his own ego and is not prepared even to campaign properly.
""Christine will always put the people first and what's what politics should be about...putting the voters first.""
Ms Jardine said: ""I am here today to pledge to make supporting women in business across Gordon and beyond a priority if I am elected to Westminster next week. 
""To do this, I will establish a formal network which aims to introduce young women to successful mentors from across the world of business.
 ""I want to make sure that any young woman in Gordon with an idea or an ambition, has the support, encouragement, and confidence they need to make it a reality.
""Working with business associations, I hope such as the Elevator, and other schemes already in place, I will use my experience and position to make sure that women have access to mentors that complement the other support available, and help them on their way to running or starting their own business.
""The Liberal Democrats in Gordon are the only party fighting to build a stronger economy and a fairer society, with opportunity for all at the heart of all that we do locally. Supporting our excellent young women for the future is a crucial part of realising this aspiration in Gordon, and I am committed to it."", pronunciation=Here's video of Miriam's speech and a copy of our press release of the visit.

But today the Chancellor has set out a wave of new cuts that are ideologically driven, and unnecessary. The idea that you would slash £12bn from support for the poorest working families and in the same breath cut inheritance tax bills for millionaires is beyond belief, and morally reprehensible.

I believe we have a responsibility to one another, to our communities and our planet – and that the rights we hold true are universal and must be championed irrespective of borders.

These are my liberal values. I am running to be our leader to create a progressive liberal movement that champions those values, and displays them with a clarity and consistency in everything we do. The future of our party lies in reaching out to the millions of people who share our values and showing them they belong in our movement.

To achieve that, we need to regain a definition and clarity – which we have lost, not just over the past five years in government, but for far longer. We need to make it clear what it is that motivates and drives us. When people ask what the Liberal Democrats stand for, they need a clear answer in terms of our values, beyond a list of policy proposals.

We need to overhaul the party so that everything we do is consistent with our values, so it becomes an effective campaigning machine again. This means applying our values to the way we campaign – returning to true community politics, based on empowering people to bring about change, and not being afraid to fight for radical evidence-based policy. People respect clarity and consistency, even if they disagree with you on a given issue – from drugs reform to nursery education, from climate change to prisons.

I believe in campaigning – not just to win elections, but to change people’s minds and improve their lives. Throughout my life, I have given a voice to the voiceless. As a lawyer, getting compensation for servicewomen dismissed for becoming pregnant – as an MP, taking on arms dealers and the Blair government over allegations of corruption in the developing world – and as a Minister, fighting for equality for people suffering from mental ill health.

One of our five priorities will be improving mental health services.  I think we must be the first British political party to prioritise mental health in this way - and I am incredibly proud of this decision.  

Mental health is often the poor relation of other NHS services, and historically mental health patients have lacked the same rights as those with a physical health problem.  We have made real progress in this government - introducing the first ever mental health waiting times and access standards, giving patients the “right of choice” already available in physical health, and legislating to demand local organisations give mental health complete equality with physical health.

But as we have seen here in Norfolk, there is much work still to do.  We have now committed to invest at least a massive £500m extra every year in mental health, as well as working to improve services for young people and the unemployed in particular.  The momentum we have built up for change in the past 4 years must not be lost.

Other front page priorities in our manifesto include:

Fair taxes: cutting your taxes by an additional £400 by raising the tax-free allowance to £12,500
Opportunity for every child: guaranteeing education funding from nursery to 19 and qualified teachers in every classroom
Prosperity for all: balancing the budget fairly and investing to build a high-skill, low carbon economy
Our environment protected: protecting nature and fighting climate change with five Green Laws
Quality health care for all: investing £8bn each year by 2020 to improve our NHS and guaranteeing equal care for mental health

We will be publishing more detail in the coming weeks, and will reveal the final Manifesto at our Spring Conference in March.  If you have any thoughts about the above, or want to raise another issue, please get in touch!, pronunciation=Last week the Liberal Democrats unveiled the front page of our manifesto for the next election.

There has been huge interest locally in proposals for a new Wetherspoons at the current Town Council offices here in North Walsham.
 
I have seen from your comments on this issue is that there is real support for the idea of a Wetherspoons in the town.  But I also recognise the importance for the Town of finding a suitable new home for our Citizens’ Advice Bureau and the Community Transport Service, both of which currently use the offices, and for the Town Council itself.  Many people in the town rely on these services. 
 
The Town Council offices were purchased by North Walsham District Council in the 50s, paid for by local council tax payers, and North Walsham District Council continued to own the building until a restructuring of Norfolk’s councils in 1974.  It is absolutely right that the proceeds of the sale should stay in the town.  But North Norfolk District Council has refused to say that the proceeds from the sale of the building will be kept by North Walsham.
 
The Town Council is taking legal advice on its rights over the building - but I want to work with local councillors to make sure that this doesn’t degenerate into a costly legal dispute.  I also want to make sure that we don’t lose this opportunity for valuable new investment in the town by failing to agree about the future of the building.

I have asked North Norfolk District Council to attend a summit meeting I will chair, together with the Town Council, to end this stalemate once and for all.  Do you agree?  Sign the petition here!, pronunciation=>>Support my petition to end the North Walsham Wetherspoons stalemate!<<

I’m a big fan of them, and have known our FoodBank from the very beginning. Good people trying their best to help others who are going through a tough patch for one reason or another.

The info has just been sent onto me by a constituent asking if I could put it out on my Facebook, to garner support. This I am very happy to do not least as the Lighthouse plays such a key part in Eastbourne and the town's history. 

See below a little history of the slides along with the justgiving site the group are trying to crowdfund. Have a read folks and please donate if you can, as it really is an important component in the jigsaw that make up our wonderful town.

‘Seventy one numbered and annotated slides, housed in two fitted wooden cases are up for auction. Case one contains 45 slides showing almost all the stages of construction, from the 'Bottom Anchorage commencement' up to the installation of the lantern. 

There are many unposed images of the workforce going about all aspects of the build. Views taken from the top of the cliffs, in the cable car, down on the sea stage beside the lighthouse and on site, within the foundations.’

‘The second case continues the series, showing the final stages - The erection of the lantern roof and even the tidy-up: 'dismantling of the sea.’ In addition to the construction slides, the second box also contains 11 distinctly posed images of the new lighthouse's uniformed keepers, inside and outside their new home, interior views of oil tanks, the lanterns, revolving gear etc. The box further contains four stunning views of the lighthouse at sunset, twilight, night etc, signed by the Eastbourne photographer Ellis Kelsey. There is also a hand coloured slide of the completed lighthouse, but still with the sea stage and cable car alongside, annotated WH Carpenter.’

‘The lighthouse took two years to build and was constructed from 3,660 tons of Cornish granite, mined and shaped on site at the De Lank quarry near St Breward in North Cornwall. The dovetailed granite blocks were numbered to aid assembly. The construction site of the new Beachy Head lighthouse at the base of the cliffs required a cofferdam to be built in order to protect the groundworks. Men and materials were winched down in a cable car or aerial ropeway which was erected from the top of the cliffs for this purpose. The site was also accessed by a hair-raising series of ladders, that ran all the way up the cliffs of Beachy Head.’

I popped into Friston Ward the other day to meet the staff and have a general catch-up of their situation and would like to update you, my FB friends. 

And what an enjoyable experience it was! Seeing up close the work of the team, many of whom have been with the paediatric unit for years, was inspiring. We all know they’ve been through some challenging times over the past few years but their ambition for the children and their determination to keep improving the children’s service at our DGH was clear as a bell. 

The Matron, Liz Vaughan, is someone I’ve known for a long time and frankly is a force of nature in local paediatrics, with a reputation that I trust implicitly. To hear from her what the future looked for our children’s ward was reassuring for me and I hope it will be to you as well, so in her own words: “We were delighted to show Stephen around the unit for him to chat to the unit’s doctors, nurses and admin staff. He showed real interest in the work we do to care for local children and their parents. Stephen recognised the benefits of our philosophy that children should only admitted overnight if their care cannot be provided safely as a short stay. Offering assessment and treatment on the unit enables a child to return home quickly which is good for both them and their parents.” 
 
I am also very supportive of the direction of travel with Friston Ward looking to move toward 23hr cover. It was explained to me that this would enhance the service even more so I told Liz that if she and her team needed any support, they could count me in.

It’s been a long haul for our paediatric services folks, we all know that. It’s been tough on parents, staff and most of all the towns children as the cuts and changes happened over the years, many of which I vigorously opposed, but what I saw on my visit was real progress. 

The morale, determination and sheer love from the staff toward their patients and their belief now in the service they deliver - just bowled me over.

You can play along in lead up to PMQs at noon.
----------------------------------------
I believe that Universal Credit, since the brutal cuts the government have introduced since 2015, along with their benefits freeze, has become genuinely damaging to many of the poorest in our society. And the government's  unrelenting, blind determination to roll it out despite the measurable harm it is doing is, in my view, shameful. Be its impact on disabled people, on those who are self-employed or on low incomes, it is causing real hardship. 

My question today though and my examples that follow are focused on an area that hasn’t received a lot of publicity, yet it hides some utterly shameful figures - the impact of UC on families and children…..

So today we're going to play the  Universal Credit Shame Game. 

My researchers have taken a deep dive into the harmful impact that UC is doing to different groups of society courtesy of the respected Child Poverty Action Group.

These groups of claimants:
- Couples with no children
- Couples with children
- Single with no children
- Single parent with children
- Single pensioners
- Couple pensioners

Every half hour until noon, when I'm due to challenge the Prime Minister directly at PMQs, I'm going to release, in reverse order, the impact on each group, ending with the quite astonishing reality of the impact it's having on our worst hit group.

So what's the game?
---------------------------
Your job is to guess what order and how much worse off that group will be annually. 

Why am I doing this in such a way... when it really isn’t a joking matter……?

I want the public who AREN'T affected by Universal Credit to grasp just what this government is doing.

To understand what it is being done in their name…...

Because I profoundly believe the British people have a deep-rooted sense of fairness and elements of UC are simply not fair! 

In some cases it’s leading to shockingly harsh outcomes for parents and their children.

I don’t think that’s right and I suspect many others will feel the same way I do once they learn of the savage cuts to household income that some of our fellow citizens in Eastbourne and across the country are experiencing.

So with each half hourly post I'll tell you which group will be affected and by how much. 

The winner? There are no winners... as you'll see., pronunciation=Universal Credit Shame Game:

With the library only costing around £40k pa and playing such an important role in the community, I believe it is absurd that such a minuscule amount from the councils overall budget of £780m, could not be found to keep it open. 

Despite the anger at the county councils decision, the meeting actively and positively discussed what actions can be taken to ensure the leader of the council, Cllr Keith Glazier and his conservative colleagues, ‘really’ will listen to the views of local people, rather than just going through the motions with a consultation.

Willingdon Parish Council organised the meeting in Trinity Church and their Chairman, John Pritchett, facilitated the meeting. I flagged that almost two thousand people so far have signed my petition, both on-line and in the shops across Willingdon and the Langney Shopping Centre, where that Library is under threat as well. 

A colleague of mine, Lib Dem county county councillor Colin Swansborough, also told the meeting that as Chair of Scrutiny in Lewes he had asked the proposal be sent back for review, but was promptly out-voted by the three Tory cllrs on his committee.

It does make one wonder whether it’s already a done-deal.....

Anyway folks, it is really important we keep up the pressure on East Sussex county council so they turn back from what I and the vast majority of local residents believe to be the wrong decision.

Because, bluntly, private landlords don’t have the capacity to just ‘not’ be paid for months on end, as councils and housing associations sometimes do in emergency situations. And this is happening in many instances as UC is rolled out. 

I urged the government to pause the rollout to prevent a possible disaster in the making, particularly in the HB private rental sector!

It just doesn’t bear thinking about.

1632026600406302_2010927075849584,"Translated(src=en, dest=en, text=Making Cycling Safer for Our Children & Traffic Congestion Consultation:  

I was chatting last week with a couple of friends from our local Bespoke Cycle Group about their campaign encouraging more children to walk or cycle to school. As we all know many parents take their children to their school by car and I can appreciate why: the roads are busy, parents/carers drop children off on their way to work etc. But I am also receiving an increasing number of complaints about the volume of traffic and poor parking near our schools, so I’d like to support more children cycling and walking. 

It would be good for all of us as well; by reducing congestion, pollution and in the longterm also improve the overall health of Eastbourne and Willingdon residents.  A win-win outcome.

Which brings me to a local consultation about traffic congestion taking place currently from East Sussex County Council. This has come about as a result of increased housing and commercial developments in Eastbourne and Wealden. The experts from the County Council say it will take 67% longer for local journeys at peak times by 2027, and they advise countering this by promoting more cycling & walking.  

The proposal for ""PHASE 1 of the Hailsham, Polegate and Eastbourne Movement and Access Corridor"", advocates sending cyclists through Coopers Hill and Wish Hill, and then onto a 400 metre shared route on the western side of Willingdon Road. There would also be a Toucan crossing, allowing children to safely get to the schools around Ratton Ward. 

I don’t believe it’s in any of our interests to have our roads choked with traffic, and some tough choices must, frankly, be made. The practical reality is we know concerned parents won't allow children to cycle on busy main roads. Naturally they want to feel that the school journey is safe.  So the suggestion of a shared route for pedestrians and cyclists, on part of one verge along the Willingdon Road, provides a desperately needed secure corridor.  

Because of this I will be supporting the proposal. The safety, exercise and commensurate health benefits it will bring our children are too important to let slip in my opinion. If you would like to join me in supporting the proposal please see the consultation details on-line here. https://consultation.eastsussex.gov.uk/economy-transport-environment/hpemacphase1/consultation/intro/

It was in response to her letter to me which failed to come up with anything new, nor offered even a passing acknowledgment that the statutory authorities had failed the public by not collecting a sample of the gas for testing. Or that frankly they’d made a mistake by ‘not’ collecting the gas. Pretty disappointing really!

Anyway - I’ve posted my letter below for my fb followers to read. 

In a nutshell, I think the public have been let down. I’m still horrified to think what would have happened if the haze had been just that little more noxious and, god forbid, someone had actually died. Without a sample though, how on earth would we have known what it was we were dealing with? 

An appalling scenario which simply doesn’t bear thinking about.

Except that’s exactly what our statutory authorities ‘have’ to do. Their number one priority is to protect the public, which is why I have made it clear I expect the Minister and the government to take the following three actions:

1/ Fess up and acknowledge that it was an error to not collect a gas sample, and to apologise to the public for failing to do so. 
2/ To reassure the public that if such an incident were to happen again, the relevant authorities would have the necessary equipment to collect a robust gas sample for analysis.
3/ And that as the responsible department and minister, she would ensure the authorities have the resource necessary to acquire the right equipment with the capacity to collect, store and assess the chemical make-up of any future noxious haze.

My view, the majority of residents I’ve spoken to and those who’ve posted on my Facebook on the subject, is we’d just like the relevant authorities to own up that they made a mistake but also commit to learning from the experience, so that if that if such an occurrence should happen again they/we will be better prepared.

Good to support another great Eastbourne Company - County Clean - opening their new Head Office at Pacific House in the Harbour.

Mike and Debbie Walker founded County Clean eleven years ago and since then it’s become one of the largest and most successful environmental services company’s across the South East, now employing almost fifty staff. And they’re recruiting now so if you fancy a job do as either an HGV driver, electrician or telesales, do drop them a line.

Visiting the firm the other day I was introduced to one of their longest standing employees - Colin Burke - who also happens to be one of their youngest! Mike told me that Colin joined them ten years ago when he was still at Causeway School looking for a holiday job, and they sent him out on his bike delivering leaflets introducing County Clean to potential customers. He made such a success of it that a decade later, still young, he’s a senior engineer and earning a lot more than most at his age!

Well done Colin for putting yourself forward all those years ago, and well done County Clean for your growing success. It was a pleasure to see your new hq and to meet the team. Liked the big truck as well......next time, can I drive it?

I met Eastbourne’s bi-polar support group recently and was enormously impressed with the support and encouragement they provide each other. Being bi-polar is a challenge - bit of an English understatement that - and the group emphasised to me just how valuable and supportive they find it, being able to meet regularly with others who live with the same illness. 

If you would like to learn more about the group, please email their co-ordinator Tim Wood on tim@managing-bipolar.org.uk or visit their website www.managing-bipolar.org.uk

Mental Health generally is back in the headlines again with conflicting reports that on the one hand the government is making mental health services in the NHS a priority, alongside consistent reports that the service remains woefully under-funded. Certainly from my perspective as your MP, the numbers of constituents who contact me with stories of inadequate care or provision lead me to believe we still have a long way to getting it right. 

And we really need to, not least as mental health issues are far more common than some realise. My own mother, who I was very close to, was bi-polar and this meant that on a number of occasions it fell to me to help her through some difficult patches. From this experience I learnt, close up, just how frightening and debilitating the illness was. 

And like most people with a mental health problem, she was perfectly capable most of the time but when an episode occurred then all bets were off! These were awful for her and, as you can imagine, traumatic for the family. 

However from them also came two lasting lessons which I’d like to share with you my Facebook friends in case they’re of any help. 

Firstly when someone is mentally ill they need good quality medical care, and secondly they need to know those around will be there for them. Still to love and support the sufferer, come what may. 

I don't profess to be an expert on mental health - who is? But if either one of the above are unavailable, for one reason or other, it makes it much harder for the patient to recover. This is why I am so committed as your MP to ensuring our NHS does a better job for people suffering with a mental health condition, and also why I think it's vital that the loved ones of the sufferer dig as deep as is necessary to support the individual. 

It can be hard for both party's sometimes; I won't deny that, but standing shoulder to shoulder with someone experiencing a mental health episode is, I believe, crucial in supporting them in their recovery.

My dear Mum meant the world to me and her pain at her mental illness broke my heart at times but her gift to me was timeless. The gift of being a loving mother. I miss her still.....

All the best to Tim, his friends on Eastbourne’s bi-polar group, and to my FB friends who have mental health issues on world mental health day.

See the copy & pics below for 12 hours doing what I love most - serving you as your MP:

1/ started at the Arndale with my regular monthly surgery (1st Saturday of every month). Always a good way to be available for residents if they have any issues I can help with. Great response and it was as busy as ever. 

2/ dropped by the Samaritans stall on the way out. A wonderful local charity that I’ve supported for years. Lovely people making a difference for good. Thx all.

3/ onto Wyntercon to hook up with founder Andy Kybett to be shown around. He’s a big lad in many ways and what he and his team have pulled off this year is just astonishing. I remember him coming to see me five years ago with his vision for Wyntercon and he’s achieved it in spades! This is the fourth year and it’s bigger and better than ever. It’s was in a humungous tent on Princess Park - you couldn’t miss it!! http://www.wyntercon.com/

4/ dropped by Diana Sanigar’s house in St Anthony’s to support the Big Pink fundraiser she and her friends were holding. Breast cancer is something many of us, close friends or partners are affected by so it was a privilege to be there to support. Thank you Diane, Nicki and all the gang for putting on such an event and for providing sooooo much good cake! Hope you raised a load of money for a really important cause.

5/ onto the WRAS charity shop opposite TJ Hughes in Terminus Road to celebrate the year’s anniversary, since I first opened it - and what a year we’ve had one way or t’other!

Re WRAS I am delighted to report the shop has been a real success for the charity in raising funds for the vital work they do for sick wild animals across East Sussex. Another great Eastbourne community organisation! http://wildlifeambulance.org/

6/ which neatly leads me onto my visit to see Langney Wanderers in their game at the Borough. They won 8 - 2 against Southwick FC which is as emphatic as it gets! The Langney Wanderers have had an amazingly successful run over the last few years from pretty humble beginnings in Shinwater.  Now they’ve got three teams (under 12’s, senior team who won so comprehensively yesterday, and the Veterans). Started 8 years ago by Stephen Saunders, brilliantly supported by his wife Tracey (they put everything into the Wanderers) they’ve gone up seven leagues in as many years. A really good football club who do Shinewater, Langney and Eastbourne proud. 

And finally - finished with our fantastic bonfire night! A superb event which was absolutely packed. I’m proud to be the Patron of the Eastbourne Bonfire Society and always enjoy walking in the procession. Last night was one of our best yet with 24 societies taking part, and this was reflected in the size of the crowd lining the route. Thousands of people enjoying a fun spectacle.

In a nutshell it was started because one of the issues AC identified was the isolation experienced by many post-retirement older men, and they thought it would be a good idea to combat this by offering up an opportunity for them to come and learn how to do bits and bobs with their hands. Wood turning, building, you name it.

I thought it was a brilliant idea as though I’m utterly hopeless myself at DIY I’ve many friends who are good and even more who aren’t but love messing about with tools!! 

So I was keen to visit it three years later and see for myself how they’re doing.

And what fun it was. Not least as I knew a few of the guys but hadn’t seen them for a while, so nice to catch up.

I was told by their co-ordinator, Oscar (former teacher at Causeway) that they have on average 15 ‘shedders’ a day, have loads of different bits of kit, mostly donated free by the local community, and they still retain their open-door policy which worked so well from the very beginning. 

If you think you’d like to give it a whirl it’s at Fort Lane (near the Tesco/Staples roundabout, rear of 3 Myrtle Road BN22 7SP). Pop along for a looksee. I know the shedders will give you a warm welcome.

There is a mounting sense that the government could be defeated if it does not immediately pause the roll-out of Universal Credit

The roll-out has been an utter failure so far, with many claimants waiting over two months for their first payment and some relying on loans to survive. Rent arrears among universal credit claimants are also through the roof. 

If the Conservatives are serious about helping ordinary people get ahead in life, they must immediately pause the roll-out of Universal Credit until these issues are resolved. Reversing the huge cuts to UC in this Autumn's budget would be a good start!

I have been warning about this for months now and I am glad that some Conservative back-benchers are following my call to pause the national rollout of Universal Credit. Even perhaps their colleague, Huw Merriman, the Bexhill MP who was emphatic on the bbc politics show a few weeks ago that all was well with UC will listen to his backbench MPs?

1632026600406302_1999523283656630,"Translated(src=en, dest=en, text=BREAKING: A27 ANNOUNCEMENT

Any improvement of this shocking road is good for Eastbourne. However this does not mean that I will stop pushing for what we all know Eastbourne really needs - and that is a dual carriageway between Polegate and Lewes.

I'll be on BBC Sussex later on talking about this.

Here's the release from Highways England:

--

A proposed £75 million upgrade to improve journeys for the 26,000 drivers who use the eastern A27 in Sussex each day has been announced by Highways England. 
Four junctions along a nine mile section of the A27 between Lewes and Polegate will be improved, a section of the Polegate bypass will be upgraded to a dual carriageway and walking and cycling facilities along the whole stretch will be enhanced. 
The plans were put to the public last year, with 78 per cent of respondents backing the need for improvements. Today, (Tuesday 26 September) Highways England has announced the results of the consultation and the preferred options being taken forward at each location. 

Highways England Project Manager Tom Beasley said:
“I would like to thank everyone who took part in our consultation. It’s great to see that there is such strong backing for improvements to this section of the A27, and there were some really good ideas put forward. People’s input has helped to shape our plans and we’ve made some key changes to our proposals to make sure they deliver the biggest benefit. In particular we’ve prioritised improvements at Polegate including the Gainsborough Lane junction, over the Selmeston bypass option and introduced a new enhanced option for upgrading the Wilmington junction – all as a result of people’s input. There will be an opportunity for people to see more detailed plans when we present the final designs at public exhibition events next year.”

The plans include:
• Widening Drusillas Roundabout to improve journeys along the A27 and for north-south traffic at the junction
• A new option for upgrading Wilmington junction, making it easier for drivers to join or leave the A27 and including a horse rider and cycle friendly Pegasus crossing
• Widening a half a mile section of the A27 between the Polegate interchange and the Cophall roundabout to a dual carriageway, and an upgraded, signalised junction at Polegate
• Near to the Polegate interchange, as a result of the consultation, introducing new proposals for upgrading the Gainsborough Lane junction by providing a right turn facility
• Significant enhancements to the walking and cycle routes along this nine mile stretch of the A27, including a new pedestrian and cycle path between Firle and Polegate
Proposals to upgrade Selmeston junction have been withdrawn after no options could be found that would deliver a worthwhile benefit without having an unacceptable impact on the South Downs national park.

The proposed plans will help to make journeys more reliable, ease congestion and improve safety along this section of the A27, especially at the key pinch points in Polegate and Wilmington. They are part of the Government’s record £15bn investment in roads between 2015 and 2020, which is improving people’s journeys, making roads safer and boosting the economy. 

A public consultation on the options was held from 27 October to 8 December 2016. A total of 1,140 responses were received during this consultation. Ten events were held at venues near the A27 east of Lewes scheme corridor for the public and stakeholders including local authorities, landowners and businesses, with over 1,000 people attending the events.

78% of people who responded to the consultation questionnaire said they are very concerned about road safety, with 70% very concerned about congestion or delays at junctions.

Any improvement of this shocking road is good for Eastbourne. However this does not mean that I will stop pushing for what we all know Eastbourne really needs - and that is a dual carriageway between Polegate and Lewes.

I'll be on BBC Sussex later on talking about this.

Here's the release from Highways England:

--

A proposed £75 million upgrade to improve journeys for the 26,000 drivers who use the eastern A27 in Sussex each day has been announced by Highways England. 
Four junctions along a nine mile section of the A27 between Lewes and Polegate will be improved, a section of the Polegate bypass will be upgraded to a dual carriageway and walking and cycling facilities along the whole stretch will be enhanced. 
The plans were put to the public last year, with 78 per cent of respondents backing the need for improvements. Today, (Tuesday 26 September) Highways England has announced the results of the consultation and the preferred options being taken forward at each location. 

Highways England Project Manager Tom Beasley said:
“I would like to thank everyone who took part in our consultation. It’s great to see that there is such strong backing for improvements to this section of the A27, and there were some really good ideas put forward. People’s input has helped to shape our plans and we’ve made some key changes to our proposals to make sure they deliver the biggest benefit. In particular we’ve prioritised improvements at Polegate including the Gainsborough Lane junction, over the Selmeston bypass option and introduced a new enhanced option for upgrading the Wilmington junction – all as a result of people’s input. There will be an opportunity for people to see more detailed plans when we present the final designs at public exhibition events next year.”

The plans include:
• Widening Drusillas Roundabout to improve journeys along the A27 and for north-south traffic at the junction
• A new option for upgrading Wilmington junction, making it easier for drivers to join or leave the A27 and including a horse rider and cycle friendly Pegasus crossing
• Widening a half a mile section of the A27 between the Polegate interchange and the Cophall roundabout to a dual carriageway, and an upgraded, signalised junction at Polegate
• Near to the Polegate interchange, as a result of the consultation, introducing new proposals for upgrading the Gainsborough Lane junction by providing a right turn facility
• Significant enhancements to the walking and cycle routes along this nine mile stretch of the A27, including a new pedestrian and cycle path between Firle and Polegate

This after weeks of telling me they were narrowing it down to one of the 150 or so vessels in the area at the time......

And as all the other agencies appear to have basically concluded that 'we do not know what the gas was as firstly we did not have the right equipment to take a sample, and secondly its transient nature meant there was no time to collect a sample' The whole outcome has turned out to be very disappointing.

And to be blunt, this is simply not good enough!

Then members of the public affected by the gas either at Birling Gap or across Eastbourne (of which many were) could have suffered a much more severe reaction.

I've been covered in the Guardian (see below) and debated Tory MP Huw Merriman from Bexhill & Battle (who obviously thinks there's nothing to worry about) on BBC South East's Sunday Politics show, before delivering my speech on topic at the Lib Dem Conference. 

I called for opposition parties to work together to demand a pause to the roll out before it's too late.

If we're unsuccessful I believe this Christmas will be bitterly hard for hundreds of Eastbourne families, and many thousands beyond. And that's simply not right.

Almost £3bn has been taken out of the scheme by this government. It was there to support people in low income work, which was the whole point of UC, and it's now been slashed to ribbons by this government. I am beyond angry at their actions as they've succeeded in keeping all the bad bits of UC and dumping its main, progressive original purpose!

And it is society’s most vulnerable who are picking up the tab, again.

In Hastings the foodbank and rent arrears (10-80%) spiked quickly following its introduction earlier in the year. I fear the same will happen here unless we can persuade the Conservatives to pause the national rollout.

One, I already flagged to my FB friends in a previous post, was the handing in of a Bill I co-sponsored on behalf of WASPi women. 

The other was to do with the governments flagship new policy to provide 30 hours free childcare a week for children between the ages of 3 and 4. This is a good initiative and one I'm supportive of. I was concerned though to receive some representation from a number of child-minders over the summer who said that whilst they supported the programme, they had concerns about the levels of funding provided. 

Essentially the Department of Education provide to the county council a pot of money per pupil which is then disbursed. However it appears the amount provided is simply not enough to cover a child-minders basic costs. 

I raised this in the Chamber with the Minister and he committed to reviewing the funding. He also flagged that the county council should be levying only 7% in administrative fees, so this is something I will take up with County Hall in Lewes as soon as.

This is a good scheme which could be a game-changer for parents and their children - but we must make sure it is actually feasible in delivery.

We must ensure that our child-minders; highly qualified women (mostly) who are Ofsted checked, are adequately recompensed for the important job they do. 

And let's be clear, they want to deliver the initiative properly but to do so they must be fairly paid otherwise they'll simply not be able to afford to offer the 30free hours a week to parents.

The latest reports (this morning) that I've received from the Environment Agency are that the Marine and Coastguard Agency are, most likely, pinning the gas on one of up to 180 ships who were in the vicinity around the time of the gas cloud. The challenge they tell me is identifying which ship, as they are unlikely to own up to doing what appears to have been an illegal act, plus the boats can only be properly assessed when they berth.

I am frustrated that none of the bodies involved appear to have thought to take immediate air samples of the haze, so we all remain unclear what it's make up actually was. This, if true, is a systemic breakdown which is unacceptable. Consequently I will be writing to all the relevant CEO's to ask their Agency's draft a robust protocol for air samples to be collected as soon as practicably possible in future similar incidents, so we can be reassured that such an apparent oversight won't happen again. 

For instance a chemist over the weekend told me that it could be as simple as blowing a bicycle pump into a plastic bag in the affected area and then sealing it for checking later. Simple, effective but not, it appears, done by any of the statutory bodies dealing with the problem this time. 

I will though keep pressing the authorities to publish whatever information they do have, as without that we are all none the wiser. Not a good place to be in regard to preparedness for future incidents or to reassure people who were affected last Sunday week., pronunciation=SECOND UPDATE - Birling Gap Noxious Haze:

I've just received an update from the DGH A&E department re the noxious cloud which swept across Birling Gap, parts of Eastbourne and down, apparently, as far as Bexhill yesterday.  

The DGH Senior nurse and an A&E consultant told me the Emergency team dealt very effectively with the situation - 140 or so people with eyes streaming and clearly suffering the consequences of some sort of wind-borne cloud turning up at Eastbourne's A&E was obviously a challenge.

Initially they were told to treat it as a full decontamination issue, so all the staff had to go through this and then the patients, which was obviously both difficult and worrying for all concerned. However, midway through it became clear this was no longer necessary, and A&E staff were able to see those who remained without having to process through decontamination. The clinicians confirmed to me there appeared to be no after-effects after washing the eyes with cold water, and the respiratory itching soon disappeared. Thankfully!

They also confirmed that other bodies were working on identifying what the make up of the chemical haze was, and how it was created in the first place. 

I will keep pressing the statutory authorities on this as clearly we need to know what the gas was, not least to prevent it happening again and, if necessary, holding someone or some entity responsible for its release. Obviously this could have been far worse and I think serves as a warning which must not be ignored.

Finally I'd like to thank all the staff at our Eastbourne A&E for responding so effectively to the many additional patients who suddenly turned up to their doorstep, and for dealing with the patients natural concerns effectively. And to the Head Nurse and Doctor who briefed me this afternoon. Equally to all those others who responded so quickly on Sunday; the Fire Service, Coastguards, Police and our very own local RNLI. Thank you.

I've pasted below sections of the report from our excellent local media outlet Eastbourne Buzz for info.

Eastbourne Buzz: 'Birling Gap is expected to be open as normal today (28 August) after yesterday’s gas cloud saw the area cleared by emergency services.

While the nature of the gas hasn't been established, East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service has advised that it is 'extremely unlikely' that it was chlorine, as was being suggested on social media. The effects, while uncomfortable, were not serious and an investigation is now under way by a number of agencies working in partnership to establish the source of the gas.

Chief Inspector Bruce Mathews has said on social media that ‘East Sussex will be open to enjoy’ but added that police will continue to monitor the situation.

No one was admitted to hospital for further treatment and after an initial full decontamination treatment centre was set up at the DGH, it was later declared an unnecessary precaution, following clinical advice.'

I shared their frustration that after the Secretary of State for Transport had finally agreed to meet with them he then stepped back and it was, once again, GTR/Southern negotiating. I certainly think the Dft should be involved in the talks as they are pulling many of the strings behind the scenes, so to revert to the same as before does not show the necessary leadership this dispute needs if it is to be resolved.

However, to look to re-starting the strikes so quickly is I think unwise. So I will be writing to Chris Grayling to ask that he contact the Union immediately to ask they come back to the table to continue negotiating, and meanwhile suspend the planned stoppages.

The gap between the two sides is really not that large and a little good will, even at this late stage, from both sides, will produce dividends.

I support the union in their opposition to Driver Only Trains and I think they've won this battle. Southern now say they are substantially increasing the number of on-board supervisors so I believe the time has come to run a trial, say for three months, to see if both sides can make it work.

If the company will now, as an act of good faith, also guarantee no job losses with the Guards, we can get to the right place - which would mean a second trained member of staff on each train.

I am very disappointed to hear the talks between Southern Rail / GTR and the RMT trade union have stalled. 

Clearly the only way to break the deadlock is to get both unions, together with the Department for Transport (Dft) and Southern/GTR, to negotiate an end to this long-running despite.

Meeting each union separately, at different times, and without the Dft is using the same failed approach which has got us precisely nowhere over the last 17mts!!

Having finally got the Secretary of State Chris Grayling to engage with the union leadership I am incredibly frustrated the Dft have simply allowed the company to return to the failed negotiating tactic of seeing the unions separately 'without' the Dft being present. 

This MUST change and it must change NOW if we are to end the rail dispute, which has caused so much hardship and inconvenience for Eastbourne and across the South East.

During the general election I promised the local WASPi group that I would support their calls for the government to re-visit the transition period for those women affected by the changes in pension age, so to keep my fb friends in the loop I have pasted below what I've done thus far.

Firstly I have signed Early Day Motion 63 which calls for, “a fair transition for women born on or after 6 April 1951 regarding their pensions.” And as promised I've become a member of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI). This cross-party APPG will put sustained pressure on the Government to act, as well as scrutinise any proposals that will come forward from the Treasury or DWP.

In addition to these measures, I have only recently been a co-signatory of a new Pensions (Review of Women's Arrangements) (No. 2) Bill which seeks to, “establish a review of pension arrangements for women affected by changes made by the Pensions Act 1995 and the Pensions Act 2011.” The Bill will be heard later in this parliament.

The truth of it though is no government is covered in glory over the issue. The Conservatives in the mid 90's brought in the original changes. Labour endorsed them when they were in power, the Coalition began the formal transition process and didn't, frankly, do it very well, and Theresa May's Conservative government are now implementing the changes.

When I was last your MP and as a member of the Select Committee, I lobbied to ensure the period affected would be shorter so fewer women born in the early 50's would be impacted with some limited success. In hindsight though I can see that it's all been an unholy mess. We know that people are living much longer than they used to, which is a good thing, and people appreciate changes need to be made to the pension age but women directly affected by these particular adjustments were short-changed. I am determined to do all I can to right this wrong.

Consequently, I'll be pressing the government to extend the transition period so women affected have more time to plan their retirement, as well as demanding the Treasury find the money to ensure that WASPi women are treated fairly, which is all they are asking for., pronunciation=Changes to Women's Pension Age:

Help them reach £30,000 here - https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/southernfail/
--
The DfT is demanding that ABC pay the £17,000 legal costs from the crowd-funded Judicial Review the group brought against the department. This is after their heroic efforts in court forced a decision from the DfT on Southern Rail’s contractual breaches, resulting in the recently announced £13.4 million fine of Govia.

ABC was backed by 2,000 passengers in this action and managed to achieve more than any MP or even the Transport Select Committee could, in forcing a decision on the issue of Force Majeure. 

In finally giving Southern Rail the £13.4 million fine, the DfT managed to satisfy the Judge enough to escape court action, but is now coming for £17,000 costs from ABC!

This is incredibly unfair and, in my and others’ view, an attempt to destroy the campaign group which has been a thorn in the side of the DfT and Southern Rail on behalf of rail users throughout the dispute. It begs the question - what is £17,000 compared to a departmental budget running to billions of pounds?

Please click here to see some of ABC’s achievements: https://abcommuters.wordpress.com/2017/07/23/the-time-has-come-for-abc-phase-two-help-us-campaign-for-justice-transparency-uk-rail/amp/

They’re a volunteer-run group of rail users who came together a year ago to try and shed some light on the long-term breakdown of a management contract with Southern/GTR that is creaking at the seams and is now entering its THIRD year of special measures! With the industrial dispute on top of this – Southern Rail has been a nightmare for many hundreds of thousands of rail travellers for over 16 months now…

I worked alongside them and the Coastal Chambers of Commerce to secure a meeting in parliament with the leaders from the two unions involved in the dispute - ASLEF & the RMT. Getting them in, hearing both Mick Whelan and Mick Cash publicly commit to suspending the planned strikes in August if the Secretary of State Chris Grayling was prepared to sit down with them, with no pre-conditions to negotiate, was the breakthrough the log-jammed dispute needed. And consequently the Transport Minister took up the offer to negotiate personally with the Trade Unions, something that he should have done a year ago frankly!

ABC has been a vital campaign voice for passengers and the truth. I pay tribute to all they've done and will continue to do on our, the rail users behalf, long into the future.

So, when I heard the Dft were awarded the £17k costs I felt I had to step up and support ABC. The Dft’s behaviour throughout is tantamount to the big lumpen bully in the playground trying to stomp the group into the dust, and I am not prepared to stand idly by to let this happen.

Will you join me in supporting ABC? 

https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/southernfail/
If they reach £15,000 – they will be able to pay their lawyers, but ABC will be over.
If they reach £27,000 – they will be able to pay their lawyers, the DfT’s costs, and survive.

ABC have been there for us the last year - every rail user - from parents taking their child to a hospital appointment, you and I visiting friends in Brighton, London and beyond, grandparents and holidaymakers, commuters and residents - all of us. Throughout this whole, long dispute ABC has held the DfT and Southern Rail to account and every penny they raise over £27,000 will enable them to continue doing so. 

Now it's time for us to be there for them. 

So I have a proposal to make: Please click on the link below to donate to the group the price of your most recent rail ticket - ABC will give much better value for money, that’s for certain! – this money is essential to help cover their legal bills and bring them back to full strength, where we need them to be.

https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/southernfail/

Let’s remember that ABC is doing far more than just the judicial review case – they’re actually leading the investigation into Southern Rail and putting some sections of the media to shame - publishing all kinds of information and documents that have previously been hidden from the public. And it seems like the more effective they become, the less the press pick up on it – there was hardly any coverage of their leak of the recent Rail Delivery Group report, for example – a report buried for 2 years which strongly argues for keeping the Guard on the train for the sake of disabled and older passengers.

We need ABC to stay in business to keep Southern Rail on its toes. We all know it's a shocking service and it needs a strong, vibrant passenger voice to scrutinize the behaviour of the company (and the Dft), which is exactly what ABC will do.

I really do hope that now they are all around the negotiating table a deal can be done that gets our rail service back to normal. 

We all know, frankly, it wasn't much good before but this 16mt dispute has been incredibly hard for the rail-using public and many local businesses locally, so I am putting a lot of positive vibes on the negotiations!!

I'm now in Recess for the next six weeks as parliament closes. This means I am back to seven days a week in Eastbourne which is great. Here's hoping for a brilliant summer weather-wise. Loads of great events coming up including the inaugural LGBT this Saturday and Airbourne in a few weeks. I'll be at both and many others so hope to see you all there.

It appears clear as the days pass since the tragedy of the fire at the Grenfell Tower, that some shocking mistakes may have been made. Either with the cladding used, the lack of strict building control or, as many of the residents are reporting, the local council ignoring pleas from them over the last few years that the Tower Block was unsafe. 

Consequently I have written to the Minister, Sajid Javid, asking his department publish the long awaited review into building regs and fire-safety measures, and to publish it with no more delays!

Equally, it is obvious we need a proper and fully resourced public inquiry into the fire. Not just to satisfy what went wrong but also to identify the lessons which must be learnt from this appalling incident, so the many other tower block residents across the UK can be feel properly secure in their own homes.

A number of you have also contacted me over this dreadful fire and I can confirm that I've spoken with our own council, and they are planning a series of additional inspections alongside the Fire Authority to assess the state of risk with our own buildings. It should be noted that none of the council buildings are over six floors, the height the gov has announced need to be checked since the fire, but the council has reassured me they will do so anyway. And the twenty or so blocks we have in Eastbourne (in private hands) that are above six floors will be visited and checked. 

An awful tragedy my friends. So sad and horrible for the many victims and their families. I am sure as we remember that bleak night as Grenfell Tower was engulfed in flames hundreds of feet high, we wonder - there but for the grace of god........, pronunciation=Grenfell Tower Fire:

Dear Friend,

I spent 37 years working in schools and the last 17 of those as Head of Ocklynge Junior School in Eastbourne.

When I was Head of Ocklynge there were many challenges, many voices telling schools what to do, many opinions, but I always did what I thought was best for the children.

If, like me, you want to do the very best for the children of Eastbourne, you’ll vote for Stephen Lloyd on Thursday.

Why do I say that? There’s lots of reasons; and not the least would be the fact I’ve seen him close-up, from well before he was MP, as a School Governor for over 10 years and the passion he has for education and all our children, especially those who were disadvantaged in some way.

I saw the work he did for Ocklynge parents and thousands of others locally. I saw the brilliant work he did with apprenticeships providing opportunities for young people who have often been forgotten.

I saw the benefits of the Liberal Democrat policies of free school lunches, the extra provision of free pre-school places and the Pupil premium which has focused money and attention on some the most disadvantaged children in our society. We have seen significant cuts in our schools budgets – cuts that threaten the very existence of some of our schools and cuts that are set to get even worse if a Conservative government is elected – Stephen will fight these. 

He won’t be afraid to speak up for our children and for Eastbourne.

I know he’ll work his socks off to do everything he can for the town and for it’s children.

So, if you care about Eastbourne, and you care about our children, you’ll vote for Stephen Lloyd – and whatever your political leanings, and however strong you hold them, if you choose not to vote for him, you’ll get a Conservative MP. That’s the simple equation.

I started as Head of Ocklynge in 1999 and in 2010 I saw our local communities begin to reawaken. I saw things happening, I saw people energized, and all the children knew who our MP was!

Our children need him back. We need him back. Vote for him on Thursday: you know it makes sense.

Thank you, 

Mr Mark Trott

These terrorists, these wicked people, kill us because they hate us and what we stand for. They hate our democracy and our freedoms. I profoundly believe we must NOT let them win. Consequently the advice that we have received is national campaigning will be temporarily suspended but local campaigning is to continue. I believe this to be the right decision.

And most of all my heart goes out to those poor innocent people, and their families, who were killed or hurt by this barbaric terrorist attack. So sad. So utterly tragic.

These terrorists, these wicked people, kill us because they hate us and what we stand for. They hate our democracy and our freedoms. I profoundly believe we must NOT let them win. Consequently the advice that we have received is national campaigning will be temporarily suspended but local campaigning is to continue. I believe this to be the right decision. 

To me it's simply about basic democracy. It is about conducting the very thing these people hate the most and want to stop - free and fair elections.

I was stopped by a few people over the last couple of days (and obviously so have the Tories!!) telling me that they are seriously considering abandoning the Conservatives over Theresa May’s heartless Dementia Tax proposal announced in their manifesto last week. These are folk who've always voted Tory so methinks something is up! And guess what, it's just been announced in the media Theresa May has bowed to pressure and issued a statement that there will now be a cap on how much people will pay, which, frankly, the Lib Dems secured in coalition and Cameron subsequently dumped, but there you go.....

However the PM then goes on to say that ""nothing has changed"" 

AND SHE'S RIGHT - there is no info on what the cap will actually be, the PM she did not tell us people’s homes would be safe from the dementia tax and she also omitted to tell us that those with long-term illnesses who need treatment in the home, would not pay more!!

So, in effect, it seems the policy remains very much in place.

Very strong and very stable from the Tories.....not!

The reality of this Conservative policy of course, even with the apparent U turn, is tens of thousands of older people across the UK will face a typical charge of around £15,000 a year for home care under their plans – and for many, the bill will be much higher. 

Not good. Not good at all.

I believe we must stand up to this now - together; to force the Tories to abandon their heartless proposal.

A good friend of mine, Cat Neilson, has just brought out her first children's book, and I was delighted to be on hand to celebrate the launch at the Old Town Community Library.

She has written a series of four books, called the Sunshine Kooks. Each book takes place in Eastbourne, and each features kooky characters who live here. 

Cat tells me the idea originally came from a friend who lamented how her child was uninspired from her own school's book collection and that she did not get excited over books the way she used to. 

This consequently inspired Cat to write and try to spark local kids' interest in reading. And a core idea was that if they recognised local places and names - maybe they'll pick up the books themselves and have a look?

She then went on to contact Eastbourne-raised illustrator, Del Thorpe [http://www.delthorpe.co.uk/], who also agreed enthusiastically to collaborate with the project. He's created some wonderful illustrations which I think capture the 'kookiness' of each character perfectly.

So take a look folks - if you have young children or grandchildren and want to buy something fun but practical this Xmas, which could also encourage them to read and reflect on our lovely town - check out the Facebook Page here for info: https://www.facebook.com/sunshinekooks/

Its a not-for-profit project. With every book purchased she is able to print the next book in the series, like a chain reaction. The books will also be donated to every nursery, school and library in Eastbourne for free. 

It's all about encouraging very young children to 'get' the reading bug, which is one of the reasons why I am so keen to support her. The first book in the series is available for only £5. I already have my copy, and a fun read it is.

Good luck Cat. I think it's a great idea and I wish you all the very best with it.

Eastbourne and many other towns across the South East are reaching crisis point because of our appalling rail service. It is also time for all those Conservative MPs whose constituencies are affected by the Southern Rail disruptions to get off the fence and actually start representing the urgency of this crisis to the government.

I am absolutely flabbergasted by the kindness shown by you - my FB friends. I asked for 50 presents for the youngsters Xmas party this year. 

And you have donated over 200!

I flagged to you all a week or so ago that the county councils Through Team, who support those young people between the age of 16 - 21 who were brought up in foster homes or residential care, had asked me to ask the Eastbourne community to help give them a really great Christmas this year.

And you responded with astonishing generosity. Thank you so very, very much. 

Words, for once, fail me so I have pasted below the letter I received this morning from Hannah. The lass who works for the Through Team department and originally approached me for help. 

She says it all.......

 Dear Stephen

Trying to put into words how grateful I am to you and the Eastbourne community for the donation of presents. As a staff team we are so overwhelmed by how thoughtful and generous the people of Eastbourne have been. 

Our young people have not had the greatest start in life nor the best situation at present, however we believe each one of them has the potential to grow, change and develop in life, giving themselves a greater future and a life full of achievements. And we can all empower the young people with this truth - through the community support in Eastbourne.

One young person I saw yesterday stated “the through care Christmas Party will be the nearest thing to a Christmas I will experience as I do not have anything to do on Christmas day”. Just hearing this touched my heart to the difference we can make, and as a team the positive memories we can give to every young person at this time in the care system.

We have received over 200 amazing presents from Eastbourne residents; they have been a joy to wrap up. We are truly grateful and touched by each one of these, which will bless the young people of Eastbourne who may receive very little at this time.

Together we can make a difference to give everyone of Eastbourne a greater future - to progress and to reach their potential. One of our team today said: “What a response! They will have the best Christmas party ever known to have happened in children services.""

Words cannot express how moved, thankful and humbled we feel by the generosity shown by residents of this town.

Thank you all.

I had a meeting a few weeks ago with some good people from a unit called Through Care, which is a county council service for young men and women aged between 16 and 21 who had been in care. Either fostered or in residential homes. 

The team were incredibly impressive and their commitment to the youngsters they support was very obvious.

It's a relatively new service, and the specific work they do is to try and help young people who by law 'have' to move out of the care system when they hit sixteen cope with the change.

And these teenagers are then pretty much on their own. 

Can you imagine!!??

Anyway, this department has been set up to at least help them move into supported lodging, flats or residential hostels such as the Foyer in Eastbourne.

And what the 'Through Service' team have been doing is putting on a Christmas Party for the young people. Last year was their first. All off their own back, in their own time; cooking the dinner, prepping the decorations etc - and also buying the fifty or so presents.....

I really respect what the staff do to support these youngsters and I love the fact they provide a big Xmas shindig for them - from their own pocket - but I know it's a bit of a struggle to buy the presents on top.

So I'd like to help which is where you guys, my Facebook friends come in!

I'd like us to sort the presents - 25 young men's presents and 25 young women. Remember the age range is 16 - 21years. Plus ten or so presents for very young kids as some of the youngsters now have babies of their own.

Will you join me in buying the presents folks?

If you can help, please drop off your present - unwrapped please so the team can see gender etc, and clearly marked to CHRISTMAS GIFT, C/O Through Care Services, St Marks House, 14 Upperton Road, Eastbourne BN21 1EP

So their office reception knows what's going on, the 'specific drop off days' will be the 13th and 14th December. Please stick to these dates otherwise it could get a bit unmanageable. Thx.

I'm aware this is an ask folks but I'm doing it because I also know the Eastbourne community steps up  for its own. 

And these young people haven't, frankly, had the best break so far in their young lives. No parents, fostered or in care homes - so let's try to do our bit by supporting them in having a decent Christmas party - along with some really fab xmas presents!!

Steve has really pushed the boat out with his new shop and obviously invested every cent he's saved over the years. Well done my friend. 

He and his colleague Luke are passionate about the business and passionate about providing a really top class men's barber service in our town. 

I wish him and the business all the very best. A nice guy who knows his stuff; bringing a touch of old fashioned quality gents hair-cutting to the town centre.

In fact I'm hoping you can see the humungous improvement in the before photo ( Brad Pitt - not!!) outside their shop, and then the after with final touches being done as I'm in the chair......

""Come and help us attempt to break a Christmas Cracker World Record and enter ourselves and YOU into the Record Books.
 
Assembling at 11am on Saturday 3rd December we will create a chain linking arms from the Library, to the Town Hall and down to the Eagle Pub - with the Christmas Crackers being ‘pulled’ as the Town Hall strikes 12.

And we'll provide the crackers!!
 
The current record is 1,077 people linking arms and pulling crackers simultaneously.  We believe with your help we can beat this so do join us and be part of the fun.

Much of this is down to their outstanding Chairman, Kevin Tsang, and his very hard-working team of volunteer members who have stepped up continuously over the last 10+ years. Well done Kevin and all. Good to call you friends.

All the above prelim brings me neatly to a new Chinese takeaway restaurant that opened recently just down from where I live in Green Street, Old Town. I popped in shortly after they opened to say hello, only to discover that the owner was one of the original stalwarts from the Eastbourne Chinese Association who I've known for years. A lovely guy called Yau Lam.

The restaurant is Urban Jade and their food is absolutely terrific. Particularly for me the sweet and sour pork, Hong Kong style, with egg-fried rice. Tasty!!

Welcome to Old Town, Yau and your daughter Emily (in the pic). I wish you and the family all the very best with the new restaurant.

Have a good week folks.)",Photos from Stephen Lloyd MP's post

I attended the consultation held in Eastbourne yesterday at the Age Concern building in our town centre.

It was pretty busy but there were plenty of Highways and Dft staff on-hand to answer questions. My frustration though is the government is 'still' only talking about fine-tuning the problem rather than actually fixing it - with a dual carriageway. Similar to what we have from Brighton to Lewes. 

See my interview below with Eastbourne Buzz who were covering the consultation. 

I've also attached a couple of pics of the report and the consultation questionnaire. Do go on-line folks to check it out and complete. It's terribly important Eastbourne keep up the pressure on the government over this shocking road.

I am profoundly disappointed the new PM has not taken the opportunity to ditch one of the Tories more pernicious and regressive legislative decisions under David Cameron (whatever happened to him?) and George Osborne. It's to do with their apparent determination to penalise disabled people who are trying to find work. 

What do I mean? 

Basically the Department for Work and Pensions places claimants assessed eligible for ESA (employment support allowance) in either the ""work-related activity group"" or ""support group"".

The work-related activity group (WRAG) means officials have decided a claimant's disability or health condition currently means they are unable to have a job but 'are' capable of making some effort to find employment. 

This is an incredibly important point folks as the people in WRAG are 'trying 'to get work so in my view they should be encouraged and supported NOT actively penalised! 

And what I mean is currently people in WRAG get up to £102.15 a week in ESA payments while attending employment focused interviews and training, but from April 2017 under the rule changes payments will drop by almost 30% to £73.10 for new claimants. That is one hell of a drop in your income if you are affected. An absolute slash and burn of ones money to pay bills, look after any children someone may have - survive even.

The government trumpet that this cut 'only' affects new claimants and not current recipients. So? Do they take people for complete idiots. Those of our neighbours, friends or whatever in WRAG, know full well they are re-assessed every couple of years or so. Consequently they are well aware this decision WILL effect them sooner rather than later.....

I think the decision is despicable AND dim. 

Despicable because I fail to see how 'supported into work' a disabled person will feel if they're income is to be cut by 30% in one foul swoop! And dim because it will be a MASSIVE disincentive to be placed into the WRAG group as folk will try to get into the support group, where their money is not affected and they do not have to try and seek employment. Which would be a tragic wasted opportunity. Just tragic.

This decision is simply wrong and unfair, so I would hope even at such a late stage the Tories change their mind. Perhaps a good time to do so would be when the new Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond makes his Autumn Statement in a few weeks time.  

I certainly hope so and will be watching very closely......, pronunciation=GOVERNMENT TO CUT SOME DISABLED PEOPLES INCOMES BY 30%.....

Dear All - there's a tremendously talented group of Eastbourne Artists who have recently opened a shop in the Enterprise Centre called @ The Makery. (It's down by the butchers for those who know the Enterprise).

One of their members is a very talented friend of mine called Lynda Lindfield who does bespoke jewellery (Anderida's Secrets). And I have to say at a very reasonable price!

I'd bought a couple of old threepenny coins at a junk shop the other day and asked Lynda if she could turn them into cufflinks, which she's done brilliantly. The link here for me is 'threepence' was my first weeks pocket money when I was a kid (that ages me!) and I fancied the idea of wearing them years and years later as cufflinks. 

Anyway - that preamble is because Linda then introduced me to the rest of her colleagues who are also part of the @ The Makery co-operative and I visited them the other day, as can be seen in the pic. 

It's a fantastic shop displaying the twelve artists output so I wanted to let all of you, my FB followers know. Particularly as Christmas is coming up and it's always nice to give an original gift to our loved ones. Their gallery/shop is open 7 days a week. 

The three founder members of the group are Sonya Tatham, Dani Jones and Suesie Seedpod, and when I asked them to sum up their vision for the shop they said: 

""We opened @ The Makery in the Enterprise Centre to bring an affordable mix of original local art and design to Eastbourne.""

And after visiting the shop I heartily agree. So do try and pop in and have a look when your next in town. I can promise you it's well worth the trip.

Equally important for me though, is it's yet another example of our Eastbourne community working productively together to improve what our town has to offer. Well done all.

Dear All - as the dreadful service from Southern Rail and the impact of the strikes have dragged on over the last few months making it such a misery for so many local commuters, I thought you might like an update on the crowd-funded and independent Judicial Review (JR) campaign I'm supporting. 

See below the latest:

..........

Dear backers,

We would like to direct you to our legal update on our site www.abcommuters.wordpress.com – our latest post announces that our lawyers have written to the Dept for Transport requesting to know if they are adequately monitoring health and safety issues on the network.

With the publication of the Select Committee's report on 14th October, our case against the DfT has been greatly strengthened and our lawyers consider it an absolute game-changer – more information soon as we are able to release it. In the meantime, we highly recommend reading the full report here: http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmtrans/64/6402.htm

The report backs up the arguments we have been making for months and substantiates the claims on which we will be going forward to the application stage of Judicial Review. We are unable to release our legal grounds, but it will not be much longer now - please bear with us as we pull the last pieces of the case together.

To those of you who have emailed and not yet received a response, please accept our apologies. This campaign has been overwhelming in its scale, and we are currently managing it on an entirely unpaid, voluntary basis. We are very grateful for all the messages of support and will be getting in touch with you all individually just as soon as we can.

Legal updates will be published as soon as they are available on www.abcommuters.wordpress.com and alerts sent out on our public Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/ABCommuters/ and Twitter: @ABCommuters. 

For those of you who are not already members, we also suggest joining our Facebook group, which is now the most active online space for discussion of the crisis: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1208771822490198/ 
............

This looks encouraging folks. I'll keep 
you in the loop with any further 
developments over the JR. 

I remain strongly of the view that the Dft should step in & take responsibility here as it's pretty common knowledge they've been pushing Southern Rail behind the scenes to introduce driver only trains. Something on longer journeys certainly that I have real
doubts about, based on the large number of women from Eastbourne who have told me they would 'not' feel
safe travelling to and from London late
at night without a Guard on the train.

Hopefully the JR will force the government to act constructively to sort this absolute horlicks of a rail service for Eastbourne (and beyond) residents.........., pronunciation=SOUTHERN RAIL - Update on Judicial Review of the Department for Transport (Dft).

BBC INVESTIGATE PRIVATE PATIENT AMBULANCE COMPANY.

As many of you will know, for many months now I have been watching closely an ambulance company called Coperforma. A private patient ambulance business who were given the Sussex NHS patient transport service contract by High Weald CCG last April. And my FB friends will know that I am not a fan, to put it mildly!

Last week the BBC SE and BBC Sussex radio broadcast a powerful expose into one of the ambulance co's that Coperforma sub-contracted to; VM Langfords. And more importantly, a character called Matthew Quigley who bought it out and then quickly ran into the ground.

I've been working with the BBC on their investigation - see their report below - very interesting behaviour from Quigley; and he's done it before! 

Link to BBC South East story: https://youtu.be/jyT715-uXw8

Two things shine out from this investigation in my opinion: firstly I believe City of London Police who apparently had a file on him but closed it - should re-open the case immediately. 

And secondly - combining this shenanigans with some dreadful stories of delays and/or non-pick ups for patients to be taken to hospital along with the utterly disgraceful way some of the loyal, long-standing NHS patient transport drivers have been treated since the contract was privatised in April this year. All emphasise to me that we simply MUST bring this service back into our NHS where it belongs. If you agree - please sign and share my petition below.

As for Quigley and his ilk? 

I hope the police pay the man a visit. 

It's just not right for people to get away with this sort of behaviour - it's 'our' NHS he's been kicking around - and in my opinion he should be brought properly to book......

I've just got a call from a local resident to say that Jeremy Hunt, the Secretary of State for Health, is making a ministerial visit to our very own DGH right now (Fri am).

Rather than just shaking a few hands (and I'd love to read the minds of the staff who have been told to line up and sprout pleasantries at him!)

I believe she made a bad mistake by not doing so.....

So let's send a clear message to Jeremy Hunt about some of the things the Health Service has been doing wrong under his watch.

Last year for the first time we had an Xmas Market at the Bandstand. It was run by our own Chamber of Commerce and I thought they made a really good stab at it considering it was the first one. I visited and spoke with a number of the stall holders who agreed and were planning on doing it again if there was to be a repeat. Well I've heard from the Chamber there is and it will be expanded as well!

See below what they've put out:

-------

With just 10 weeks to go until the launch of the Bandstand Christmas Market, Eastbourne unLtd Chamber of Commerce are calling for final applications from traders. 
 
Last year, the 5 day market attracted over 25,000 attendees, with over 90% of the traders based in Sussex. This year in responding to demand, organisers have confirmed that the market will last for 16 days and expand with 35 stalls covering both levels of the Bandstand. 
 
Billy Obeney who traded last year said “I’m really looking forward to the Bandstand event. Last year’s event was easily the best market I’ve ever been involved in. Not only was it a great, festive atmosphere. I’m busy ordering as much stuff as possible as last year – I almost ran out!”
 
Luke Johnson on behalf of Eastbourne unLtd said “We are working really hard to ensure that this year our bandstand Christmas market is bigger and better. It’s important to us that not only do we have unique offerings at the bandstand but we support our fantastic local traders.”
 
Luke concluded “The team are shortly to meet to start making decisions on which traders to allow – so if you’d like to be considered, then please do get in touch by calling 01323 641 144”. 
 
-------

I'm all for this folks as it fits what I was always trying to encourage when I was your MP - to support new business opportunities for Eastbourne and increase footfall into our town. The Chambers Christmas Market fits both these objectives, so if any of my FB followers think they could make the most of this trading opportunity then do get in touch with Luke @ the Chamber.

Eastbourne is full of great businesses and this could be an ideal opportunity for them to enjoy a really successful Xmas period.

I was delighted to be invited to formally open the new WRAS charity shop at 192 Terminus Road this morning, alongside their founder Trevor Weeks MBE. I've known Trevor and been a big supporter of WRAS ever since I came to Eastbourne. The organisation he started up many, many years ago does an incredible amount of vital work helping, rescuing and protecting wild animals that have been injured; either through illegal traps, malicious intent, hit by vehicles or the myriad of other causes.

The new shop (opposite TJ's) is a significant investment by the animal charity. And Manager John Racher asked me to flag that if you have any spare clothes, bric a brac etc they'd be hugely grateful if donated to WRAS, and that all would be put to good use.

Equally if you think you'd like to volunteer in the Shop please email his colleague Chris on chris@eastsussexwras.org.uk

I've pasted below a brief summary of the work WRAS do but look on their extensive website for more details:

............

""East Sussex WRAS was established as a voluntary group in 1996, but some of its rescuers have been rescuing since 1985.

http://wildlifeambulance.org/, pronunciation=EAST SUSSEX WILDLIFE AND AMBULANCE RESCUE SERVICE (WRAS) OPEN NEW SHOP IN TERMINUS ROAD.

I was delighted to be invited to formally open the new WRAS charity shop at 192 Terminus Road this morning, alongside their founder Trevor Weeks MBE. I've known Trevor and been a big supporter of WRAS ever since I came to Eastbourne. The organisation he started up many, many years ago does an incredible amount of vital work helping, rescuing and protecting wild animals that have been injured; either through illegal traps, malicious intent, hit by vehicles or the myriad of other causes.

The new shop (opposite TJ's) is a significant investment by the animal charity. And Manager John Racher asked me to flag that if you have any spare clothes, bric a brac etc they'd be hugely grateful if donated to WRAS, and that all would be put to good use.

Equally if you think you'd like to volunteer in the Shop please email his colleague Chris on chris@eastsussexwras.org.uk

I've pasted below a brief summary of the work WRAS do but look on their extensive website for more details:

............

""East Sussex WRAS was established as a voluntary group in 1996, but some of its rescuers have been rescuing since 1985. The organisation was set up in order to provide a front-line rescue service for wildlife casualties who unlike their domesticated cousins, do not have owners to help look after them.""

""WRAS deals with calls from members of the public and other animal welfare organisations like the Swan Sanctuary, Fox Project, Southdowns Badger Group, International Animal Rescue, British Divers Marine Life Rescue, Sussex Bat Hospital and many others.

I do find the constant twists and turns of Coperforma quite extraordinary. We've seen the service for NHS patients deteriorate since High Weald CCG gave the private ambulance provider the contract last April, and the treatment of some of their staff (many of whom live in Eastbourne) via the sub-contracted co's taken on by Coperforma has been absolutely shocking. And now it seems they are up to their same old tricks with another of their subbed company's - Thames Ambulance Service, which covers Sussex and Brighton.

See below what I've got from the GMB who I've been working closely with for months now in support of the ambulance drivers. And what they are alleging is absolutely disgraceful behaviour if true......

""It appears that ruining both Langford’s and Docklands wasn’t enough for Coperforma CEO Michael Clayton as Thames Ambulance (owed £600,000 by Coperforma) now appear to have incurred his wrath, and we start to see the familiar pattern of undermining the contractors through disputing and delaying the payment of invoices. Work is purposefully removed and dissipated amongst others within the contract when any organisation questions their failure to pay invoices due for work ambulance units and crews provided.""

Folks: This is just appalling. It is a classic 'payments squeeze' operation from an unscrupulous private business - Coperforma - and it cannot be allowed to continue in our health service!

1/ That High Weald CCG gave our NHS patients transport service to a company whose service to local residents across Eastbourne and Sussex has often since been reported to be poor.

It was to be called Wyntercon and would bring a whole new set of visitors to our town. The genre - fantasy, steampunk, sci-fi and more - was not an area I knew much about but I was impressed with Andy's tremendous enthusiasm and his obvious personal financial commitment to the project. 

Equally importantly, as the then MP I could see it was a different type of Festival which could, if it succeeded, bring a whole new group of tourists/visitors to Eastbourne to spend money in our town. An objective I always had and still have at the front of my mind.

Suffice to say I wholeheartedly agreed to back Andy and do what I could to help make Wyntercon a reality. And I am absolutely delighted to see that all this time later it's grown to be a major success, as he originally dreamt.

We are now onto Wyntercon 3 and he's joined these days by the excellent Greg Draven (another lovely big guy with a beard!) and Lucy Kay as co-directors & co-organisers. It's on next weekend - see booking details below - and they're looking to top the incredible 2,500 visitors they got last year.

I have been passed some further confidential papers which raise important questions which need answering by High Weald CCG. 

1/ The shareholding in the private Patient Transport Service provider who were given the PTS service by High Weald CCG in April this year - Coperforma - is, according to the records at Companies House, made up of three blocs. The biggest of which is a company called Seabourn Limited.

However, according to my source they allege there has never been a Company of that name registered, dissolved or even currently awaiting registration from Companies House which means - legally - Seabourn Ltd does not actually exist.

Under the due diligence appraisals which I assume we're made by High Weald CCG, why was this not checked? 

2/ Recently a number of the company's Coperforma sub-contract sections of the PTS to, said they were facing extreme challenges with having their invoices settled by Coperforma. 

If this is true, shouldn't the CCG be siting this as a breach of contractural obligation by Coperforma to deliver a robust PTS to patients in Sussex?

3/ What is the legal status of Dockland Medical Services in all this? 
I ask because according to the CQC (Care Quality Commission - the body which assesses the quality of medical providers) Docklands Medical Services (London) Ltd 'does' hold CQC registration but it went into liquidation earlier this year with debts of around £100,000. A new company was then formed, with the same director, called Dockland Medical Services Ltd but without the London suffix, and it does not appear to be CQC registered!

Docklands has subsequently closed its doors with some of its drivers still not being paid for the work they did in August. This is appalling for them and their families. Many of whom had been dedicated NHS employees for decades.

My next question therefore is why did the CCG allow this company to take on the sub-contracted PTS work as (a) it may have been doing so without CQC accreditation and (b) it clearly possessed inadequate funds to pay all its drivers?

4/ My source also tells me that Coperforma is still not functioning properly. With crews often transferring one patient at a time rather than several as before, and ambulances being sent 50 - 100 miles across the county to collect one patient whilst those nearby are bypassed. This means delays for some patients and appointments missed along with the obvious stress it must cause.

What are the responsible CCG doing to independently audit a transport service which Coperforma keep saying is running well, whilst I hear from drivers something very different? 

                       ...................

We deserve answers from the CCG. They are ultimately responsible as it was their decision to move the PTS contract from NHS SECAMB to a private provider. I hear they had no choice as the funding provided was inadequate. Well if that's the case the government are equally culpable for not providing enough money to keep it in the NHS!!

Patients deserve better as do our long-suffering patient transport ambulance drivers.

Docklands has subsequently closed its doors with some of its drivers still not being paid for the work they did in August. This is appalling for them and their families. Many of whom had been dedicated NHS employees for decades.

My next question therefore is why did the CCG allow this company to take on the sub-contracted PTS work as (a) it may have been doing so without CQC accreditation and (b) it clearly possessed inadequate funds to pay all its drivers?

4/ My source also tells me that Coperforma is still not functioning properly. With crews often transferring one patient at a time rather than several as before, and ambulances being sent 50 - 100 miles across the county to collect one patient whilst those nearby are bypassed. This means delays for some patients and appointments missed along with the obvious stress it must cause.

What are the responsible CCG doing to independently audit a transport service which Coperforma keep saying is running well, whilst I hear from drivers something very different? 

                       ...................

We deserve answers from the CCG. They are ultimately responsible as it was their decision to move the PTS contract from NHS SECAMB to a private provider. I hear they had no choice as the funding provided was inadequate. Well if that's the case the government are equally culpable for not providing enough money to keep it in the NHS!!

Patients deserve better as do our long-suffering patient transport ambulance drivers. 

Help me keep the pressure up on High Weald CCG by sharing and signing my petition below. Thank you.

Please see below a message sent to me from Siobhan, a relative of one of the two victims. It says it all:

Following the court case where Jordan Hunt was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving, appeals have been lodged by Maria and Richard's families against the sentence. We have also set up a petition calling for lifetime driving bans for people convicted of causing death by dangerous driving and requesting a review of sentencing guidelines for similar cases. 

We want to get this petition seen by as many people as possible, especially those local to Eastbourne. As a local yourself you'll know that Eastbourne has a decades-old issue with 'boy racers' so you know that it is a topic keenly felt by many people.""

I fought hard to bring in Lillian's Law when I was Eastbourne's MP to stop people who were driving under the influence of drugs from getting away with it. It was simply not right that someone could potentially put others lives at risk with complete impunity. 

I am signing this petition on the same basis. Individuals should be held properly to account for their actions.

When a law is inadequate in some way or even simply wrong - it is the duty for good people within a democracy to ensure it is changed.

It's going to be a load of fun, homemade cakes galore (you'll be unsurprised to learn that I'm running the cake stall.

And as for the responsible CCG? 

A stunning example of a public sector body appearing to avoid taking responsibility for the decision 'they' took to move the Patient Transport Service from SECAMB where it had been working well for years, to a private supplier who promised more for less. 

And who singularly failed to deliver on their promise!!

However it was the High Weald CCG's decision. Their choice - so - I expect them, the CCG, to ensure that Coperforma pay their suppliers NOW, so the staff can receive what they're owed - and we can get back to some semblance of a decent, efficient patient transport service for local residents.

And if we cannot - then I believe the CCG should remove the contract and give it back to SECAMB, where it ran successfully for years.

See the link below to an interview myself and Gary Palmer from the GMB have just done with regard to the absolutely dreadful ongoing situation of our local patient transport service.

It's complicated but the background context in a nutshell:

1/ The CCG (Clinical Commissioning Group) High Weald removed the contract from NHS SECAMB in April this year and gave it to a private supplier called Coperforma. This is to deliver/pick up all non-emergency NHS patients across Susses (dialysis, pick up and drop off from Hospitals etc). 

2/ Coperforma had a shocking couple of months as the media was filled with failed patient pick-up's etc

3/ Meanwhile Coperforma subbed part of their service to a company called Langfords who quickly and rather oddly went into administration (a separate issue I am still investigating. A Mr Quigley appears to have a rather chequered history and was involved).

4/ Another company called Docklands Medical Services took on the arrangement from Langfords.

5/ In all this, 70/80 staff mostly from Eastbourne or nearby, who had been with the SECAMB NHS patient transport services for years were moved from pillar to post to each company, with money allegedly still being owed before ending up at Docklands. 

So in a nutshell, the drivers tell me the patient service is still very poor, some did not get their salary this month at all, while others got only half to two thirds, their fuel cards had run out of money, their mobile phones which Coperforma issue with an app to sort pick-ups (that's another story!) were or had run out of credit which obviously meant cancelled pick-up's. 

Docklands meanwhile allege they couldn't pay the staff all they were owed, as Coperforma hadn't fully paid them - and so this horrifying tale of incompetence, anxiety for patients and employees and, frankly, chaos goes on.

With the result that local staff, our neighbours in Eastbourne many of them, have been treated shockingly and patient care are suffering.

The GMB (thank you Gary Palmer. He's been working. 24/7 trying to help here) and I have been trying our level best to get the issue out there, and it seems the pressure we are applying finally may have some impact. Tomorrow - Monday 5th Sept - the CCG are sitting down in the same room with Coperforma and Docklands to try and resolve the issue. Both from the staff's terms and conditions perspective and the quality of the patient service. 

About time frankly! 

To me the key responsibility has to be the publicly funded CCG. They picked Coperforma. It's a very valuable NHS contract, its using a private provider because they 'promised' a better service at less cost to the taxpayer and that we'd all be better off.

Yeh right........!

Another thing is the mobile phones we use with Coperforma's app on them. Since Docklands took over we've been supplied with pre pay mobile phones which again regularly run out of credit.

Sorry folks this is a complicated one but stick with it as it affects our NHS.......

Many of you will remember last April when there was a change in non-urgent patient care transportation locally, the then provider - SECAMB - lost the contract to a new company called Coperforma, and we soon heard how bad the new service was. I posted myself about it a couple of times as I was contacted by a number of patients and drivers who were dismayed at the deterioration in standards.

Apparently though, more recently the service was supposed to be getting much better - for both patients and the drivers - which was good news. 

However, unfortunately this doesn't appear to be the case and I've been told there are still poor practices taking place. 

For example in In the first instance the Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) provided by Coperforma do appear much better - upwards of 95% patient satisfaction. Tremendously encouraging, until I was recently told by some of the staff that Coperforma are only publicising the 'completed journeys' in the figure and NOT the 'failed to pick up' or 'incomplete journeys'.  If this is true it could mean there 95% is utterly spurious. 

I stress I have no proof - only what I have been told. So if any of my FB followers can enlighten me via a private message please do so. 

The other area where things are most certainly not getting better has been Coperforma's treatment of some of the staff via its sub-contractors, including one which only recently went into administration, called VM Langfords. 

It appears that the company who replaced Langfords - called Dockland Medical Services (DMS) - had agreed, along with Coperforma, to take on all the drivers under the same terms and conditions. 

Shockingly this promise has just been turned on its head and it's been brought to my attention that DMS have written to all the transferred staff saying they will now be given notice and dismissed from their current NHS contracts, and offered inferior pay and terms contracts on a take it or leave it basis.

If this is true it is an absolute disgrace. The whole point of TUPE (a legal protection for staff in the NHS if another provider - usually private - becomes their employer) is to protect NHS staff from unscrupulous cost-cutting measures. Why is this being ignored?

So, let's get this all straight: it's been alleged to me that Copeforma are basically massaging their performance KPI's, and a bunch of local drivers who have given a valued service to patients for years when they were with SECAMB are now being totally sold down the river. 

Meanwhile at the original CCG (High Weald) which made the commissioning choice of going with Coperforma in the first place, no-one has being held to account!

And in Eastbourne what have we really got in return? 

A form of back-door privatisation of an NHS service that is now worse than it was and where many of the staff are being treated dreadfully.

1632026600406302_1794551744153786,"Translated(src=en, dest=en, text=GOV TO RADICALLY EXPAND BADGER CULL?

It appears the first major act of the new  Environment Secretary, Andrea Leadsom MP, will be to sign off on a significant expansion of the governments badger cull. According to a report by the BBC the number of badger cull areas are to be increased exponentially, into Devon, Cornwall, west Dorset and Herefordshire.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) refused to confirm the report, but did not deny it.

As your MP I was actively against the original pilot culls and worked closely with the Badger Trust and the RSPCA in parliament to try to stop them. Along  with a colleague of mine called Adrian Sanders who was then the Lib Dem MP for Torbay. An absolute inspiration to me when it came to animal welfare - and another who lost his seat to the Tory £squillians! A sad loss in Westminster on behalf of the animal world; a thoroughly decent bloke and seriously hardworking constituency MP as well.

Anyway, back to this BBC Report. If it 'is' true then I am utterly astonished as (a) the science is simply not proven and (b) why in gods name, in the 21st century, can't the gov come up with a working vaccine rather than resort to shooting a magnificent wild creature such as a badger? In the original Pilot around 4,000 badgers were shot.....

And even if we leave aside the moral case for slaughtering them, which does not exist in my view, let's at least listen to the scientists. 

And an absolute string of eminent individuals have criticised the cull from Professor David Macdonald, who chairs Natural England’s Science Advisory Committee, describing trials in 2013 as an “epic failure” And Prof Rosie Woodroffe, a scientist at the Zoological Society of London, and a member of the gov's own advisory panel who looked into the original pilot cull said the ""findings show unequivocally the culls were not effective and that they failed to meet the humaneness criteria.""

What more evidence does Leadsom actually need? 

The response from the RSPCA has been equally damning as they said they were ""saddened but unsurprised at the restart of the badger culls, but to extend the number of cull areas further is alarming – especially when the last three years of culls have been such a failure.""

Then in September last year, eminent scientists including Professor John Krebs, formerly president of the British Science Association, wrote an open letter to the media demanding an end to badger culling saying that experts had concluded culling made ""no meaningful contribution to cattle TB control in Britain"" And that ""after a Government-funded, £50m study over 10 years a vaccine for cattle should be a priority. The Government has failed to develop one for TB. UK cattle are already vaccinated for up to 16 diseases – why should TB be different?”

I do hope the government will row back from this alleged decision before it is too late. I also note though that our new Secretary of State wants to bring back fox-hunting, so don't think we should hold our breath......, pronunciation=GOV TO RADICALLY EXPAND BADGER CULL?

It appears the first major act of the new  Environment Secretary, Andrea Leadsom MP, will be to sign off on a significant expansion of the governments badger cull. According to a report by the BBC the number of badger cull areas are to be increased exponentially, into Devon, Cornwall, west Dorset and Herefordshire.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) refused to confirm the report, but did not deny it.

As your MP I was actively against the original pilot culls and worked closely with the Badger Trust and the RSPCA in parliament to try to stop them. Along  with a colleague of mine called Adrian Sanders who was then the Lib Dem MP for Torbay. An absolute inspiration to me when it came to animal welfare - and another who lost his seat to the Tory £squillians! A sad loss in Westminster on behalf of the animal world; a thoroughly decent bloke and seriously hardworking constituency MP as well.

Anyway, back to this BBC Report. If it 'is' true then I am utterly astonished as (a) the science is simply not proven and (b) why in gods name, in the 21st century, can't the gov come up with a working vaccine rather than resort to shooting a magnificent wild creature such as a badger? In the original Pilot around 4,000 badgers were shot.....

And even if we leave aside the moral case for slaughtering them, which does not exist in my view, let's at least listen to the scientists. 

And an absolute string of eminent individuals have criticised the cull from Professor David Macdonald, who chairs Natural England’s Science Advisory Committee, describing trials in 2013 as an “epic failure” And Prof Rosie Woodroffe, a scientist at the Zoological Society of London, and a member of the gov's own advisory panel who looked into the original pilot cull said the ""findings show unequivocally the culls were not effective and that they failed to meet the humaneness criteria.""

What more evidence does Leadsom actually need? 

The response from the RSPCA has been equally damning as they said they were ""saddened but unsurprised at the restart of the badger culls, but to extend the number of cull areas further is alarming – especially when the last three years of culls have been such a failure.""

Then in September last year, eminent scientists including Professor John Krebs, formerly president of the British Science Association, wrote an open letter to the media demanding an end to badger culling saying that experts had concluded culling made ""no meaningful contribution to cattle TB control in Britain"" And that ""after a Government-funded, £50m study over 10 years a vaccine for cattle should be a priority.

Just to flag a couple of events taking place in Eastbourne today (Sunday). In the morning there is the Dementia Memory Walk on behalf of an excellent national charity I know well - the Alzheimers Society. It's all about raising awareness of dementia as well as providing funds to assist the charity campaign and undertake research into the disease. 

The Walk starts at 10.30 from the Channel View entrance on Princes Park; then goes onto Holywell and back. It's an amble not a race folks and the weather report looks very promising. Fingers crossed.

I am doing it on behalf of my lovely, favourite Aunt, Bernedette. She is suffering terribly from this ghastly condition so anything I can do to help raise awareness and funds to fight it - I'm up for that.

If any of my FB followers would like to join us on the Walk on behalf of any of your family or friends who also have dementia, it would be great to see you. Also if you wish to donate just a few pounds to the Alzheimers Society please go the JustGiving site our organiser, Tony Bates, has set up. See the link below: 

https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/MW16anthonybates?utm_medium=email&utm_source=ExactTarget&utm_campaign=20160724_70371

Then from midday onwards is the splendid Hampden Park Funday, organised by Jim Murray and his excellent team. See the poster below. It's enormous fun, a great family event and I always enjoy seeing so many old HP friends as I potter around the stalls and events.

I'll be along later after doing the Memory Walk, so offers of free cake to help me get my energy back after a 5km stroll will not be turned down!

Dear All - one of the more common diseases we hear a lot about these days is dementia. The numbers are pretty grim with around 225,000 people developing it every year in the UK. It's an illness that touches most of us in one way or t'other. 

Speaking for myself, my favourite Aunt, Bernadette (yup I'm half Irish) has advanced dementia and its affected this wonderful, ebullient, marvellous woman shockingly. Something that sadly many of you will also recognise from your own experience. 

I'm flagging this because in August, September and October - Memory Walks - will be taking place across the country to raise money on behalf of the Alzeimers Society. An established charity that I know well who support families affected by dementia and campaign for better provision. Both subjects close to my heart.

There is an Eastbourne Memory Walk taking place this coming Sunday (21st August) that has been organised by a local guy called Tony Bates. Thx Tony. Well done.

It starts @ 10.30am from the entrance of Princes Park, top of Channel View Road. It will then go along the seafront to Holywell and for those that are up for it, the walk back. 

I'll be doing it along with Tony and others, the whole walk is about 5 miles and, trust me, it's an amble not a race. As well as walking for a worthy cause we'll be taking the opportunity to enjoy our lovely seafront and, speaking for myself certainly, squeezing in the odd ice cream or two on the way.......

So if you'd like to join me, do come along and join in or even if it's just to wave the Walk off on the Sunday morning, I'll be there with the others from around 10.15. 

Even more important though - if you can - please do donate in the JustGiving page that Tony has put up (see link below). His target is 500 quid and I'd really like us to help him reach that amount. Remember when any money is donated, JustGiving send it directly to the Alzheimer's Society. 

We all know that an awful lot of our loved ones are affected by dementia in Eastbourne. I'm also acutely aware of how many of you work tirelessly in the care sector battling the disease - either in Care Homes or the NHS - all doing your level best to look after people who have dementia. Trying to make their lives as comfortable as possible. Thank you, truly.

So if any of my FB followers fancy joining me in doing the Memory Walk and/or donating just a few pounds, it will be a pleasure to have you on board. I'm doing it for Auntie Bernedette, Tony is doing it for his Mum - who might you do it for? 

Thx folks, as ever.

It really is incredibly strong and I'm convinced one of the reasons many of us love our town and its values as much as we do. What's not to like when local people put so much back into where they live?

Anyway - I'm flagging this because when I was in Morrisons a couple of weeks ago to open their refurbed bit of the Store, I was also talking to Maureen Barnhoorn and Sue Hatcher from the Hampden Park Art Group. I've known both these wonderful ladies for yonks so it was nice to catch up as well as see the exhibition of their members work (see them in the pic below)

And whilst I can't paint for toffee, looking at what was on display it was obvious the group had real talent.

Both Sue and Maureen though emphasised to me that a key part of the Group was also social, to be with like-minded people and to support the Hampden Park community etc - all the things which I was talking about earlier. I told them I'd be very happy to spread the word as they're also keen to welcome new members, hence this post!

They are also blessed in having an extremely accomplished professional artist and teacher who runs their classes. Her name is Teresa Currie who leads a number of art courses across Eastbourne, not just in HP.  Should you wish to contact Theresa to enquire about joining any of her groups the email is taccurrie@aol.com

Why not give it a go folks. Could be fun and you may even discover a long-hidden artistic talent......

It's a very important festival for both the town's economy and reputation, being one of the biggest premier events along the south coast.

Airbourne is a good indication of how we're stepping up as a town and this year obviously we've had the Horlicks of the Southern Rail dispute to contend with, but ever the optimist - normal train timetables should be back from tomorrow.

It begs the question why aren't the government trying to sort the dispute out?

In my view the Dft are using Southern Rail commuters as cannon fodder to push through their policy of driver only trains, come what may. It's also clear their strategic agenda is to drive down costs across the rail network by cutting staff. 

Meanwhile we suffer and the service suffers. A poll of rail users by Transport Focus put Southern 24th out of 26 co's when it came to overall customer satisfaction and this was before the current industrial dispute! Not a record to be proud of but one commuters to and from Eastbourne will recognise.

Whether they are called Guards, Conductors or whatever, it is clear that many rail passengers feel more secure knowing their is another member of staff on the train other than the driver. But it seems the government is wilfully refusing to acknowledge what we, the passengers, actually want.

This attitude is arrogant and simply wrong. It's effectively ignoring the public. And yet we're the ones paying for one of the most expensive rail networks in the world.

It is time for the Secretary of State at the Dft to intervene and not hide behind the nonsense of ""nothing to do with me guv"" as illustrated by the Argus article.

It's unfair on long suffering passengers and it is causing real difficulties for businesses as their employees struggle to get to work on time or, frankly, often at all. Equally tourism is suffering; not least Airbourne which is vital to the economy of our hospitality sector.......

I'm not always a fan of the RMT, to put it mildly, but do think we, the fee paying passengers, are right to prefer a service which guarantees another rail staff member on our train. For all the obvious reasons around safety, security and the accessibility of disabled passengers.

The weather just about held off today so the committee and supporters of this year's Eastbourne Cancer Research 24 Relay were able to enjoy a lovely garden meal, celebrating the success of this year's event.

Under the outstanding leadership of Janet Geering we raised the grand total of £33,133.26p for Cancer Research. An absolutely astonishing amount of money. Well done Jan and all those who took part. Making a difference for good!

And it really was a team effort which involved an awful lot of people. Thank you all.

Jan asked if I'd agree to be President of their fundraising committee again next year. I said yes! A good cause, a great bunch of people - and - have you ever tried saying no to Janet?

Only joking. It was a pleasure. Next year we'll raise even more money. Cancer is such a swine and, sadly, many of us have been affected through losing people we love. I am sure that's why Eastbourne (and beyond) steps up every year so generously to support our 24hr Relay.

The business was started by the family when they opened in Eastbourne all of 54 years ago by Helens parents, who were originally from Cyprus. 

Her mum, such a lovely lady, still does most of the cooking!! Whenever I'm there I pop my head into the kitchen to say hi to Mama. Frankly If I had her energy - I'd be PM by now.

Steve, Helen, Mama and the girls. It is a real pleasure for Cherine and I to know you as good friends. Thank you for looking after us so well on so many occasions over so many years. Really appreciated. xxxxxx

Folks: If you're from Eastbourne I'm sure you already know the restaurant and if you haven't been for a while - go and enjoy!

It was a pleasure to go along, hear what both teams have been up to and to meet all the participants. And I was very, very impressed.

Each team has raised hundreds of pounds for good causes, they have been on a residential course on the Isle of Wight as well as undertaking various other community fundraising events in and around Eastbourne. 

Well done to you all. I can promise you that what you're learning on NCS will come in great use for your future lives.

And after a bit of negotiation, they did!
Many have done fine work with them since or gone on to other employment after been out of work, in some cases, for years.

Good constituency politics to me is all about making a positive difference to real people's lives. In fact the programme Morrisons introduced in Eastbourne with my urging & encouragement is now standard practice across the UK whenever they open a new store.

It was much more though than just a pitch for Hilary Clinton. It was, I felt, highly prescient for our current troubled times.

And we do live in a difficult epoch particularly in trying to deal with the appallingly brutal behaviour of ISIS which is causing so much fear across Europe, the U.S. and most of all, in the Middle East. 

Their disgusting, evil actions are designed to cause worldwide mistrust. To sow the seeds of suspicion amongst us; between Christian and Muslim, East vs the West, their nihilistic values against our democratic, tolerant societies.

Whilst alongside this, in the race to be the next US President, Donald Trump more than any other leading Western public figure that I've ever known in my lifetime, seems also to be deliberately and indiscriminately fanning his own flames of rage amongst the U.S. electorate. To me he's playing right into ISIS hands, making a difficult situation so much worse. Often with grotesquely inaccurate hyperbole and invective, toward anyone and everyone with a different view to his own. Even those from within his own country!

Let's call it for what it is - Trump is pandering to the worst that is in all of us and in so doing he is, almost literally, throwing petrol on an already burning fire.

However I refuse to accept the incoherent, fearful world he portrays. Not least because much of what Trump says is simply not true unless that is, we 'will' it so......

Because there is another way, a way of hope, courage and optimism in the face of adversity. And I thought Michelle Obama's speech (below) captured this perfectly.

She reminded us that we win by working together, by not demonising a whole people, a whole religion or in the United States election campaign at the minute, god help us, even whole ethnicities. 

We win - by being our better selves.

Watch her speech - and hold on to its vision in the coming months and years as together we battle to defeat ISIS, which we will. As together we reject the road of fear that some closer to home are trying to force us down. 

I urge our American friends and all of us here in the UK to rise above the wanton indiscriminate mistrust toward 'the other' being sold by the likes of Trump and his ilk, as they cynically stoke our anxiety of ISIS's barbarism for their own venal political ends. 

Watch carefully what he and others are doing and saying. As without due care they could turn us, also, into barbarians.

Michelle Obama's speech was about how we are all better than that.

Thx to the Hampden Park Bowls Club for putting on such a great event for the Mayor Cllr Pat Hearn and for making us all feel so welcome. It was good to be amongst so many old friends.

Then afterwards onto the Borough FC at Langney Sports to support the lovely Brenda and Bob Bigsby. A football tournament fundraiser they and their team of volunteers (lead by the amazingly industrious Laura and Andy Hollobone) had put together to raise money for the Tuesday O'Hara Fund. It was in memory of their son Paul who died tragically and far too young of testiculer cancer at only 29 years old. 

The tournament was a success particularly considering it's the first one they've put on, and the plan at the mo is for it to become an annual event in Paul's memory. A full 12 adult football teams with 84 people took part. All on the Borough's sensational new all-weather 3G pitch. 

Players and teams from across Eastbourne, Hastings and Lewes took part. And it was a pleasure for me to be there to hand out the medals and winners cup.

This is a newish type of unit designed to see people who may have had to be admitted in the past to one of the hard-pressed hospital beds.

I just want to flag how hugely impressed we've been with the team - nurses, HCA's, receptionists, doctors, radiographers, RVS volunteers - all of them. They have been enormously efficient and kind to us through the whole period. A heartfelt thanks to all of you.

I know many of the staff at the DGH as a lot of them were helpful to me, Liz Walke and the SavetheDGH team as we were having to deal with the 'not much missed' previous chief executive Darren Grayson. I heard many good things about them from former patients when I was your MP - of the care given by our DGH teams across the board. 

We saw it with our own eyes this week. Thank you - from both of us.

I'd like to flag to all my FaceBook followers that I have decided to re-stand as your MP in the forthcoming general election, whenever that may come!

Since the general election result fourteen months ago I've been touched by the almost constant words of support and encouragement from people across Eastbourne and on my FaceBook page, urging me to stand again as your representative. For which many, many thanks.

I've continued to be as involved locally as I have always been. From helping organise our splendid Sunshine Carnival to actively supporting numerous other community initiatives such as the recent fantastic 24hr Cancer Relay fundraiser - and many more. I've been with you every step of the way.

It's always a pleasure for me to work alongside other's as we strive to make a difference for good in Eastbourne. I love it. It's why I care so much about our town. 

It's genuine sense of community married to our shared values are what in my view make Eastbourne just that little bit special.

I was enormously privileged to serve as your MP and if, when the next general election is called, I am re-elected people know that I will always put Eastbourne above party politics. 

It's what I stand for, it's who I am and it's what I did before. 

Make no mistake the next few years are going to be very challenging both for us and the country for a multitude of reasons, but I believe I've the necessary experience, commitment and vision to ensure Eastbourne comes through stronger and better than ever.

To beat the local Conservatives though I do need your support, so will you join in my campaign to be your MP again? 

If you want to help please share my post, sign up below or message me on FB:

By pulling together I am convinced we can do it. Between us we will make the positive difference it takes to win for our town.

Many of you will have heard that a great local charity called the Now! Charity Group were broken into a few days ago in Eastbourne. Their safe was stolen, a window wrecked and wall damaged when the thieves pulled out the safe. 

I know the charity and worked really closely with them over the years. They're a truly dedicated group of people working in an area I was (and remain) passionate about when I was your MP. Helping people who have been long term unemployed into jobs and training. 

I popped around to see them today and they are all in good heart and determined to keep doing what they do so well, irrespective of the break-in. 

I also had a good chat with their inspirational chief exec Petrina Mayson to ask if there was anything I could do to help.

Trina flagged the burglars had obviously stolen some money so it occurred to me it would be nice to try and raise some funds to compensate, at least financially. To show that Eastbourne always rally's round its own. 

So please see below the just-giving link. Click on it and then follow to Now! Charity Group if you think you can spare a few pounds. The thieves stole £300 and equipment as well as damaging the office so I am sure any amount we can contribute will help. 

She also reminded me that it costs them only £100 to teach someone to read and write; wouldn't it be tremendous if we could raise double the £300 stolen? That way - 6 local folk who struggle with literacy could benefit. 

They always need new volunteers so I've also posted their website below if you think you can help as a possible volunteer?

I know a lot of the team. They're genuinely a fantastic bunch of people trying to do the right thing. So let's try to step up for them at this time of need.

The charity's website is: www.nowcharity.org.uk

And if you think you can donate a few pounds go to www,justgiving.com and then to find their donation site tap in Now! Charity Group.

Today's publication of the Chilcot Report comes up with some profoundly worrying conclusions. No doubt the vast amount of paperwork will be pored over for months to come but 3 of its key conclusions  are:

- ""We have concluded that the UK chose to join the invasion of Iraq before the peaceful options for disarmament had been exhausted. Military action at that time was not a last resort.""
- ""The judgements about the severity of the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction - WMD - were presented with a certainty that was not justified.""
- ""Despite explicit warnings, the consequences of the invasion were underestimated. The planning and preparations for Iraq after Saddam Hussein were wholly inadequate.""

The report adds their committee was 'not' a court or a jury. And were therefore not set up to make any legal findings. However the conclusions go just about as far as they possibly can within that limitation saying: ""We have, however, concluded that the circumstances in which it was decided that there was a legal basis for UK military action were far from satisfactory.""

I find this extraordinary and it is a precedent that must never be repeated!

Shockingly it also appears we were not prepared at all for the aftermath. It is astonishing to see in black and white, the conclusion that ""there were no substantive discussions of the military options, despite promises by Mr Blair, before the meeting on 17 March"" - that was less than a week before the war began.

It's obvious from the evidence there was not enough planning or preparation by the military, and not enough capacity for a long-term commitment.

Frankly, I think the then UK government let down our brave men and women who  served our country in Iraq; many with their lives.

This is unutterably shameful. 

And equally damning is that although military action might have proved necessary to stop Hussein at a later date, it was 'not' the last resort at that point as Blair said because according to Chilcot: ""there was no imminent threat"".

The fall-out from the result of last Thursday's referendum continues to reverberate across the UK, Europe and further beyond. Meanwhile the whole range of human emotions seem to be sweeping the TV studios, radio, print and social media outlets - from elation to despair, anger to joy - and all points in-between.

Anxiety is evident as many people and institutions are now asking themselves and others; ""what are the real consequences of leaving the EU?"" ""what happens next?"" ""what is the financial cost likely to be?""

Meanwhile some of our leading political figures are either going of their own accord or are under severe attack from their own mp's and shadow ministers who want them to go. We will have a new Prime Minister - who? - in a few months time and the Scottish government has just started preparing legislation for a second independence referendum.

Truly - it was a seismic political/economic decision that we took, one way or another, on June 23rd 2016.....

Amongst all this hullabaloo I've been wracking my brains to think what can positively be extricated from the situation. Now is the time for cool, experienced, sensible heads. Now is the time for proposals that bring us all together rather than continue to pour paraffin on the fire. Proposals which actually 'improve' our political process going forward, and not make it worse!

And I think I've found something that could, which I'd like to share with you, my facebook friends. Something productive to enhance our political discourse, decisions, trust and even outcomes for the future.

It's another petition but I think a practical one which may actually work, and can be supported by all fair-minded people of any or no political persuasion. 

In short I know a lot of people are totally fed up - on all sides of the political spectrum - with being lied to by some of our politicians and sections of the media. So rather than just complain about it - let's do something productive.

Let us demand that future national campaigns, elections etc are at least based on facts. True, verifiable facts which stand up under scrutiny so that we can at least ensure our decisions are properly informed and based on 'facts' rather than spin or even, at times, outright lies. 

I've signed this online petition at change.org which I'd like to bring to your attention. 

............................................................

PETITION - Restore truthful politics: Create an independent Office of Electoral Integrity.

In UK political campaigns it is becoming ever harder to distinguish fact from fiction. This undermines the integrity of our democratic system.

The UK government should establish an independent Office of Electoral Integrity (OEI) to factually verify the truthfulness of claims made during political campaigns. It should hold campaigns to account, with powers to issue fines and factual clarifications.

There is precedent for such a body. The Office of Budget Responsibility (http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk was established by the UK government to provide independent and authoritative analysis of the Chancellor's Budgets and Autumn Statements.

An Office of Electoral Integrity is necessary to ensure that the British public are told the truth, and to restore faith in our democratic process.

............................................................

If we get enough people signing we can demand our political party's add to their manifesto's the promise to introduce the OEI were they to form a government, and if they don't, draw our own conclusions. 

If you agree with me please share my post, then click on the link below and sign the petition:

Anxiety is evident as many people and institutions are now asking themselves and others; ""what are the real consequences of leaving the EU?"" ""what happens next?"" ""what is the financial cost likely to be?""

Meanwhile some of our leading political figures are either going of their own accord or are under severe attack from their own mp's and shadow ministers who want them to go. We will have a new Prime Minister - who? - in a few months time and the Scottish government has just started preparing legislation for a second independence referendum.

Truly - it was a seismic political/economic decision that we took, one way or another, on June 23rd 2016.....

Amongst all this hullabaloo I've been wracking my brains to think what can positively be extricated from the situation. Now is the time for cool, experienced, sensible heads. Now is the time for proposals that bring us all together rather than continue to pour paraffin on the fire. Proposals which actually 'improve' our political process going forward, and not make it worse!

And I think I've found something that could, which I'd like to share with you, my facebook friends. Something productive to enhance our political discourse, decisions, trust and even outcomes for the future.

It's another petition but I think a practical one which may actually work, and can be supported by all fair-minded people of any or no political persuasion. 

In short I know a lot of people are totally fed up - on all sides of the political spectrum - with being lied to by some of our politicians and sections of the media. So rather than just complain about it - let's do something productive.

Let us demand that future national campaigns, elections etc are at least based on facts. True, verifiable facts which stand up under scrutiny so that we can at least ensure our decisions are properly informed and based on 'facts' rather than spin or even, at times, outright lies. 

I've signed this online petition at change.org which I'd like to bring to your attention. 

............................................................

PETITION - Restore truthful politics: Create an independent Office of Electoral Integrity.

In UK political campaigns it is becoming ever harder to distinguish fact from fiction. This undermines the integrity of our democratic system.

The UK government should establish an independent Office of Electoral Integrity (OEI) to factually verify the truthfulness of claims made during political campaigns. It should hold campaigns to account, with powers to issue fines and factual clarifications.

There is precedent for such a body. The Office of Budget Responsibility (http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk was established by the UK government to provide independent and authoritative analysis of the Chancellor's Budgets and Autumn Statements.

An Office of Electoral Integrity is necessary to ensure that the British public are told the truth, and to restore faith in our democratic process.

............................................................

If we get enough people signing we can demand our political party's add to their manifesto's the promise to introduce the OEI were they to form a government, and if they don't, draw our own conclusions. 

If you agree with me please share my post, then click on the link below and sign the petition:

A great local charity called Embrace East Sussex are running a Fete tomorrow (Saturday) from 10.30 onwards at the St Anthony's Centre on 557a Seaside. I know them well - it's a fantastic group of volunteer parents who promote activities, life skills and inclusion for disabled children. 

In fact many of you will have seen their absolutely stunning float from the carnival where they won a highly commended rosette, judged by the Mayor. 

See the poster below folks. Do try and come along, as it's an important fundraiser for Embrace. Bring the kids and you can all have a lovely fun-filled day.

A fine example of one of the many Eastbourne community groups who put so much back into our town.

Well. The people have spoken! I won't deny I am very disappointed we will now be leaving the European Union, and that I do fear for the possible knock-on affects to both the UK and further afield. You know me and I won't lie. 

However, as I posted yesterday, first and foremost I am a democrat and wholly believe that the view which wins the most votes from the public must be respected. I hold that sentiment profoundly. 

So: my congratulations to the Leave voters. You will now have the chance to develop our nation outside of the EU. I wish you well and as its 'our' country I'll do all I can to work with you in a constructive manner. 

For my Remain colleagues. I am so sorry. Many of you felt, like I did, that we would be better off staying alongside our partner country's in the EU, working together. However, a new chapter in all our lives has now opened so let's make the most of it. This is a great country, full of wonderful people - from all sides of the referendum persuasion - so after a few days getting over the shock, let's pick ourselves up and do our very best to make the whole thing work. 

For Eastbourne? This is the greatest darn town I've ever lived in or had the honour of serving, bar none! I love it here. Our strength of community and its mutual respect from the overwhelming majority of residents is just tremendous. So whatever your stance on this referendum let's continue doing what we do so well - keep putting our town and community first.

That's all folks. Thank you for being my FB friends. I do appreciate your interest and support.

1632026600406302_1766213503654277,"Translated(src=en, dest=en, text=Patient Transport Update: 

Apologies for the long post. It's a fiendishly complicated issue, and I can only imagine how dire it is for the affected patients and ambulance drivers!

Here goes: 

As many of you know our non-urgent ambulance service has been run by new providers Coperforma since April. And from what many people have been telling me, it's been pretty awful. The poor drivers have had to cope with a shockingly bad collect & despatch system, with the consequence that the long-suffering patients have often been left high and dry for hours, and sometimes not collected at all. In some cases making their own way to their dialysis treatment. And last but not least, our own cash-strapped NHS Trust (ESHT) has apparently had to pay out thousands of pounds in taxi fares for patients who should have been picked up - but weren't!

So just when you think it couldn't get any worse, a company working as part of Coperforma's new patient transport contract has gone bust under rather dubious circumstances.

See this from The Argus: 

Administrators have been sent into a firm which provides patient transport vehicles for under-fire contractor Coperforma.

Four ambulances have been seized on behalf of the company's creditors, from locations including Bognor and Worthing.

A period of moratorium has been declared for V M Langfords, and administrators have said that patient welfare is their uppermost concern.

Langfords provide 40 vehicles for Coperforma Ltd which took over the patient transport brief in Sussex on April 1.

..................

Then if all this wasn't bad enough I've been sent the additional info below. Read it and weep!

""Stephen - the truth behind the collapse of VM Langfords Limited. The biggest scandal to hit the UK Ambulance sector""

The collapse of VM Langfords has been skilfully planned to revolve around the previous owners and the relationship with under-fire Coperforma. In fact the previous owners have just had their business hijacked and Coperforma, aware of what was happening, have been creating a contingency plan to maintain the patient transport services throughout the region.

The man behind the collapse of VM Langfords Limited is this man http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-26390126. Matthew Quigley (his pic below). See www.endole.co.uk. In the last 6 months Quigley has created the following companies; Acadian Limited, EMS Vehicle Hire, Exbloit Limited, Medlert UK Limited and Acadian Holdings Limited. Some are showing Quigley as Director and some are showing him as Shareholder. In order to take control of VM Langfords Quigley negotiated the deferred purchase of VM Langfords Limited from Calvin Hanks and Michael Langford by using a fake ID called Matthew Curran. See shareholding of Acadian Holdings Limited.

The shares in VM Langford Limited were transferred to Acadian Holdings Limited with Quigley's colleague, Neil Obbard, appointed as Director of both. With Quigley masquerading as Curran, the new owners proceeded to order 35 blue light ambulances at an estimated value of £2m.

The vehicle converters were tipped-off and held the delivery back, concerned that the assets would diverted away from their supposed destination. If this was Quigley's intended scam it didn't stop him from coming up with a plan B. All supplier payments were stopped as the company continued to insist on faster customer payments; staff were left wondering if their salaries were going to be paid as the new company VML Ambulance was formed.

Last week vehicles started to be repossessed and with Quigley well and truly hidden in the background from his Regus office in Basingstoke www.vmlambulance.com he started to master the ultimate plan to rescue the doomed company from the Administrator www.peterhall.org.uk. He had destroyed it as Curran and was now going to take it for nothing as Quigley.

VM Langfords Limited was a £3.5m company. Hanks and Langford were promised future payments for the sale of the company. Suppliers are estimated to be owed in excess of £300k. Now that the company has been put into Administration Quigley has formed VML Ambulance Limited (incorporated last Thursday). Director James Nugent has worked with Quigley for years. VML Ambulance Limited have approached the Administrator to take the company straight out of administration, cancelling off the company debts and acquiring the assets for a pittance.""

They've been keeping me informed from start to finish - invited me to their original committee meeting, put on various fundraising events, prepared the birthday cards with the children which will be sent on to Her Majesty, and completed their Float in good time last weekend. A crack team! See a few pics below mapping their creative journey.

So we set up a system where half of every penny raised goes into the Carnival Fund for the following years event, and the other half goes to the charitable organisations who have entered a Float or Walking Procession. 

And it's been a fantastic success due to your generosity, as we are back for our 5th year. So do please dig deep for the bucket collectors as they walk along the procession. It's 'our' Carnival so let's make sure we take care of it. Thank you.

On another note: dozens of volunteers work tirelessly to put this great event together. In numerous roles! 

One of which is sticking, by hand, up to date labels on the 375 buckets below, which we have to by law. Licensing regs etc.

This takes time as you can imagine but the Eastbourne well of community spirit runs deep - and step forward two wonderful local ladies - Marie Ashford and Anne Knowles, who have done this job every year.

Folks - I am performing a public duty in this post so I urge you to read, consider and take action.

I really love good ice cream. I don't just mean that as a turn of phrase - I REALLY love good ice cream! To the extent that a couple of years ago when Cherine and I went on hols to Rome she, bless her, as a surprise took me to an ice cream parlour she had secretly researched before the holiday, which had a reputation as being one of the best in the city. And it was. Absolutely stunning. In fact we used it every day of our holiday (a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do).

That's how much I enjoy good ice cream!!

I'm telling you this because as many Eastbourne residents will know we are blessed with a brilliant ice cream parlour in our own town. Fusciardi's. And Cherine and I dropped in the other day to enjoy a couple of their great flavours.

The founder Theresa Fusciardi was a fine lady who put a lot back into the town she came to in decades past. Sadly she died a few years ago but since then her nephew, Marino, has taken over the business. And he's re-started the tradition of making most of their ice creams on the premises using the old, original recipes. And they are simply delicious!

If you haven't been before you are in for a treat. And if you have, you know what I mean.

Thx Marino. To you and all your lovely team. See you at the weekend my friend....., pronunciation=An Eastbourne ice cream to 'really' enjoy!!

To the extent that a couple of years ago when Cherine and I went on hols to Rome she, bless her, as a surprise took me to an ice cream parlour she had secretly researched before the holiday, which had a reputation as being one of the best in the city. And it was. Absolutely stunning. In fact we used it every day of our holiday (a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do).

That's how much I enjoy good ice cream!!

I'm telling you this because as many Eastbourne residents will know we are blessed with a brilliant ice cream parlour in our own town. Fusciardi's. And Cherine and I dropped in the other day to enjoy a couple of their great flavours.

The founder Theresa Fusciardi was a fine lady who put a lot back into the town she came to in decades past. Sadly she died a few years ago but since then her nephew, Marino, has taken over the business. And he's re-started the tradition of making most of their ice creams on the premises using the old, original recipes. And they are simply delicious!

If you haven't been before you are in for a treat. And if you have, you know what I mean.

Thx Marino. To you and all your lovely team. See you at the weekend my friend.....)",Photos from Stephen Lloyd MP's post

I saw the headline above on the BBC News and, odd as it may sound, felt good about it.
 
The reason being is that up until very recently there was no law which effectively prohibited people from driving under the influence of drugs. Alcohol? Yes of course, but not drugs. 
 
I hadn’t realised this until I was approached as your MP a few years ago by a Langney couple called Pam & Peter Sanders. They told me the desperately sad story of how their 14 year old granddaughter, Lillian Groves, had been knocked over and killed by a driver under the influence of drugs near where she lived in Croydon. 

And that’s when they discovered a major gap in the law. 
 
Police had to show a driver was impaired by drugs before they could persecute.  There were also no roadside drug tests unlike the breathalyser for alcohol. Effectively people could drive perfectly legally while using Class A drugs such as heroin or cocaine.
 
I was absolutely staggered as I had, like most people, made the assumption the law would be the same as that of drink driving -  apparently not!
 
Pam & Peter asked if I would support the family in helping bring about a change in the law, so the tragic death of their Lillian might be avoided for other children and road-users. Of course I readily agreed and thus began a long campaign culminating eventually in new government legislation to stop people driving whilst under the influence of drugs. I worked closely with the MP from whose constituency Lillian and her family lived in Croydon. Gavin Barwell MP. He did a brilliant job and deserves much of the credit for the new law.  

For the family, for Pam & Peter and the over 20,000 signatures they diligently collected across our town, it was a special day when the new legislation was passed in May 2013, and then enacted in March last year by police forces across the country. 
 
Who knows how many children’s lives (and others) have been saved by the 8,000 drug driving arrests in the last 12 months?

Pat and Peter. It was a privilege to help you and your family. Nothing can ever bring back your Lillian but you can be sure - you did good in her name.

A young Willingdon lass called Kinsey Cottenham has made a heroic sacrifice to raise money for two great causes that I know well. Firstly - You Raise me Up - which is a brilliant local charity that raises money for youngsters and their families who are going through desperate times, and the excellent Eastbourne Ambulance First Responders. 

Her action to raise the money has been to have her incredibly long hair that's taken years to grow, to be shorn off and sent to the Little Princess Trust to be made into wigs for children who lose their hair through treatment for cancer. 

Her mum sent the pictures below of the deed being done at CHAPS barbers in Polegate. 

So far, incredibly, she's raised over £1700 to split between YRMU and the First Responders. All 35"" and 9ozs of hair......

The response was brilliant. Thx all. It's going to be a fantastic carnival and it's all about serving our Eastbourne community. 

THE ARTHOUSE CAFE:
Now let me tell you about a new cafe in Grove Road; it's mission is to serve great locally sourced food in a really friendly atmosphere whilst providing artistic opportunities for young children. 

It was a pleasure to be invited to formally open the cafe, to meet the two very impressive owners (Lucy & Lucy - no problems with me remembering the name!) and their talented, enthusiastic team. 

I love the concept, it's another innovative business opening in Eastbourne and it will be an excellent addition to the other established outlets in Grove Road.

Take a look below at the pics and their link. With half-term coming up it looks a perfect venue for the kids to enjoy whilst you have a lovely slice of cake! Whats not to like?

Have a great bank holiday Monday folks and - remember - see you at the carnival on Saturday June 11th......

1632026600406302_1749628805312747,"Translated(src=en, dest=en, text=SavetheDGH maternity update:

Dear All - I visited the midwifery unit at the DGH with Liz Walke and other members of the campaign team yesterday. It was a productive visit and gave us all an update on the services provided by the midwife-led unit at our hospital. 

I also met the Trusts new Chief Executive, Dr Adrian Bull. He strikes me as being very clear on the challenges facing the DGH and determined to address them. I certainly hope so.

A small pointer which bodes well for the future after the un-lamented departure of the ghastly previous CEO Darren Grayson, I noticed that passing staff were obviously pleased to see Adrian and that he stopped to talk with them. A straw in the wind perhaps but an encouraging omen.

Moving on to our visit to the midwifery unit, we were all impressed by the obvious passion and commitment of the team. It's clear that Mums who had given birth at the DGH had a positive experience. The current birth rate is around 250 a year and we were informed they have the capacity to deliver at least double that number. 

When I asked why the numbers were so low (it's the same as it was four years ago) they said they're remained a lack of confidence locally. The maternity team were emphatic this was misplaced and that many more Mums assessed as low-risk could safely give birth at the DGH but chose instead to attend the consultant-led unit at the Conquest Hospital. With the average no's at other equivalent NHS midwife-led units being around 500 births, I'd certainly support our own midwife unit in encouraging Eastbourne expectant Mothers to use the DGH if that's what is recommended. Not least as it will be much easier transport-wise.

This brings me though to the key point of difference which remains between us and the Trust. The continuing lack of consultant provision in maternity at the DGH. Bearing in mind there are around 1800 births a year from Mothers in Eastbourne, even a desire (rightly) for the midwife-led unit at the DGH to increase the numbers of births to around 500 a year still leaves well over a thousand parents having to travel to the Conquest. And we all know the transport challenges this entails! It's bad enough if you have a car but if you don't, well......

So my advice to the new leadership team is please don't close your mind to trying to find an original and creative solution to the issue. Our uniquely poor transport links between the two hospitals surely demand proactive action. I am no medic but maybe a half-way house between a solely midwife-led unit and solely consultant-led at the DGH in Eastbourne - Consultant emergency cover perhaps? 

Certainly now is the time for the Trust to be that little bit different, to think outside the box. I am sure the intent is there amongst the staff at both hospitals to reach a practical solution. 

In short I believe the new leadership team at the Trust has a window of opportunity of goodwill from across our town and from the staff. Time to be bold Adrian. Time to be bold......, pronunciation=SavetheDGH maternity update:

I'm sure many of you are aware there has been an issue locally for the last few weeks where Southern Rail are trying to change their practices to Driver Only Trains. This does raise with me some safety concerns. Only recently for instance there was an incident up in Scotland where a driver only service exacerbated an accident which many staff feel was made worse without having a Guard on the train. 

See the Scotrail link at the bottom of my post.

It has to be said that I have real sympathy for the employees over this issue and am concerned such a cost-cutting action could be dangerous for passengers. Something which must always be an absolute priority for the train operators.

I have also been contacted (confidentially) by local staff who have told me that Southern Rail are penalising employees who went on strike to protest against the move toward Driver Only Trains. I was told the following: ""Today they have sent me and my colleagues a letter giving us an ultimatum to either go ahead with their plans or be sacked. We have been penalised for taking legal industrial action by the company, revoking our car parking passes and travel permits, to make it as difficult as possible for us to continue working.""

If this is true then it's a clear case of the Train Operator trying to bully staff whilst they're fulfilling their legal right to withhold their labour. This is palpably wrong!

Dear All - please join me in signing this petition below supporting the BBC. The government's Culture Secretary - John Whittingdale MP - is shortly presenting a white paper to parliament on the future of the BBC and I've real concerns. 

Not to put too fine a point on it there are strong voices on the hard right of the Tory Party who absolutely loath the BBC and would love nothing better than to severely clip its independence. And Whittingdale is most definately on that wing of the Tory party. He is also close to Murdoch and absolutely no friend of the Beeb as it currently stands.

My own view is they're 'ultimate' outcomes would be to remove the balance code which all broadcast organisations have to follow (unlike our 'beloved' national print press!), reduce the size and reach of the BBC considerably and undermine its independence from government. 

If you want to know what this would be like - watch Fox News in the USA for 24hrs. And weep......  

The UK comparison could be - imagine how our country would look if say the Daily Mail or The Sun broadcast into our homes 24hrs a day, AND didn't have to bother with footling, liberal, wishy washy broadcast rules like - political balance and, uh, facts!? 

If you share my concern that this government is serious about their intentions - wrong ones in my view - then please do pass on my post and sign the 38degreees petition. We need to get enough people - millions  - on board so David Cameron decides it's not worth the grief it will cost him if they try to press on.

And this isn't just liberal/left party political - an awful lot of moderate, local conservatives have flagged to me over the last few weeks that they're also a bit twitchy of what they see could be on the cards for the BBC.

So if the disgraceful, scare-mongering flat-out racist campaign the Tories ran on Zac Goldsmiths behalf had succeeded, and smeared them over the finishing line, it would have sent out one very clear and devastatingly short-sighted message across the UK and the world: That there is absolutely no point whatsoever of a moderate British Muslim getting involved in mainstream democratic politics in this country, because the Conservatives will do their utmost to brand you as a dangerous, radicalised maniac unfit to hold office on our behalf.

Are they really saying to moderate British Muslims ""don't bother, we want you to leave the floor for the cretinous, murdering, homophobic, misogynist, fundamentalist nutters instead?"" because that's what their election campaign looked like.

Damn the Tories for being so stupid, so venal, so incredibly short-sighted -  that they will do absolutely anything to win elections - even using the poxy islamaphobe card when it's so blooming obvious that our nation crucially 'needs' sensible, moderate British Muslims at the minute; probably more than we've ever done.

Zac Goldsmith should hang his head for allowing Cameron to foist such a disgusting mayoral campaign on him. Shame on you Zac. I used to think you had some integrity.

And Sadiq. Good luck. You're now the Mayor of one of the finest, biggest and most exciting cities in the world.

Last weekend was one of my favourite annual local competitions: Fish4Kidz. 

The founder, Steve Frost, came and saw me five and a half years ago with an idea. In the past kids often used to go fishing with their Dads and it was a great way to get them outdoors and also an opportunity for them to be with their Fathers. Nowadays that happens less and less with the advent of computer games etc, so why don't we start, Steve said, a new competition in Eastbourne where Dads can enter with their children? Teach them about fishing 'and' spend the day together outdoors.

I thought this was a tremendous idea - I well remember fishing with my old man - and, to me, it was a great way to spend some quality time with him. I still remember those times fondly all these years later.

So I was really happy to support Steve's original initiative. 

And five years later we just had our 5th annual competition and it was another huge success. Seventy people took part, along with numerous volunteers on hand to show the children (and some of the Dads) how to fish. 

Every year I've presented a trophy to the winner. It was called the MP's cup. Ahhmm......this year I re-named it the Patrons trophy!!!

Well done Steve. Your vision has become a reality and it's been a personal pleasure supporting you and all your fantastic team of volunteers. 

I'd also like to thank a few other stalwart supporters of Fish4Kidz - Tony's Tackle, Anglers Den, A.T. Tackle and the Angling Club. Without them it wouldn't happen every year. Thanks folks.

To be honest I'm not a huge fan of these as I think the Conservatives by introducing them run a very real risk of politicising our police forces.  However we are where we are and, to me, there's no point in burying my head in the sand and ignoring them so I will be voting. Not least as I believe the almost complete monopoly of Conservative power in Sussex does need some checks and balances.

And I want to flag that the liberal in this election is James Walsh. He's a retired doctor from Littlehampton way (the PCC post is for the whole of Sussex) and is very experienced across the whole policing gamut as he used to be the Chairman of the Sussex Police Authority before the PCC's replaced them. 

As well as having been a GP for decades, prior to that he was a Royal Naval medical officer so is a very sensible, safe pair of hands for what will be a challenging job. Particularly in a period of budget restraint for our own police force. 

I know James well so have no hesitation in backing him and would ask my FB followers to give him serious consideration. Whatever the politics of this role he is one of the 'good guys' in my opinion.

Add to this its taking over an hour to get through patient for 7am renals which means they don't get in till late if at all. Some renal patients didn't get there treatment last week again.""

""Plus there's no way on the phone to abort a job with a drop box with a reason, so yet again having to phone to cancel, wasting time trying to get through.""

""On average 3 hours of an 8 hour shift lost trying to get hold of Coperforma.""

""With no proper planning the day before and their system only allocating one job  at a time, it's no wonder there's about 400 patients still not being picked up every day.""

""Example with secamb - in a typical day a driver would move 12 patients, now if I'm lucky only 3 are transported. And that's from one drivers perspective - 6 patients not getting transport who should.""

""Crews are so upset knowing patients are suffering."" 

""Renal patients that we are supposed to pick up are having to get taxis.""

""Please help stop the mess we're in."" 

Folks - see below a local petition sent out by 38 degrees. I would urge you to join me in signing it so the numbers reach a points where the commissioning body hopefully just has to take account of our concerns.

38 Degrees article: Ambulances in Sussex are turning up hours late forcing people to miss their vital cancer treatment appointments or kidney dialysis. The problems recently started after the contract to run the ambulances was given to a private company called Coperforma. [1]

But the switch only happened a couple of weeks ago, so it’s still possible for the NHS to take back the service again. A big petition could persuade the NHS bosses to rip up the private contract and take back control of the ambulances, to run them properly and safely.

I've just come from a SavetheDGH campaign meeting where we met the new Chairman of the Trust, David Clayton-Jones (pic below). And yesterday the team had their first meeting with the new Trust CEO Dr Adrian Bull. I couldn't make that one unfortunately (I've another job these days!)  but the reports are good. Liz Walke and the campaign team will be putting out a joint statement with the Trust in a few days, so watch this space.

This mornings discussion with the new Trust Chair went well. All of us want what is best for Eastbourne (and the surrounding area) and I think it is fair to say (a) the new leadership team are certainly approaching us and the challenges faced by our hospital and NHS community in a far more positive way than the old lot. (B) It's obviously far too early to count our chickens but I wanted you all to know that we are starting well. I hope and pray it will continue and those core services we lost will be returned in some shape or other, and the town gets what we all want: a first class hospital serving the 'local' needs of the community.

I specifically addressed 3 issues with the new man 1/ go that extra mile to work 'with' the staff. Show them just how much they're valued. They've earned it by providing great quality care under the toughest of circumstances over the last few years. 2/ Transport links between us and the Conquest @ Hastings are uniquely awful and that MUST always be factored in with any clinical decision and 3/ Put pressure on the CCG's (the NHS commissioning groups) to do something proactive about the shockingly poor service being provided by the new non-urgent patient transport provider. Real people are suffering at the minute since SECAMB lost the contract which is simply unacceptable. 

I'll end on a positive note folks as that's something we all so desperately want for our DGH and community NHS Services - and that is someone at the meeting said ""now it's fresh eyes looking and working together to make a positive difference"" 

I certainly hope so. Eastbourne deserves it.

Kai has played hockey for Eastbourne Edge at the My Skateworld facility in Hampden Park since 2011, and has a real love and passion for the sport.

He was part of the team that became National Champions in 2013 and went on to represent his team Eastbourne Edge and England in the Europeans in 2014, which were held in Germany.

As you can imagine he (and his Mum) are over the moon at being given such a tremendous opportunity and asked if I could help. 

The challenge they face is they need to raise the money to ensure Kai can join the GB team in Hawaii. 

Folks - I was hugely impressed with his commitment and obvious ability, so agreed to publicise on my FB page. 

If you think you may be able to help Kai achieve his dream, do take a look at the link below.

All about our wonderful Sunshine Carnival, which is coming up in June. I've managed to get Legal & General to sponsor again this year which is tremendous. See their press release below:

Legal & General, owner of the Eastbourne Arndale Centre, has announced it will be the main sponsor of the Eastbourne Sunshine Carnival for a fourth year. The event will be held on Saturday June 11th from 4pm and this year’s theme will be the Queen’s 90thbirthday. 

The parade will start at the Western Lawns as before and finish at Princes Park with more than 25,000 spectators expected to cheer the 50 plus floats and 1,500 walkers along the seafront. 

For the first time, the carnival will also include a street market that is being organised by Eastbourne Chamber of Commerce, as well as family entertainment in Princes Park from the early afternoon with fair rides, bouncy castle and an outdoor big screen showing a movie, after the Carnival finishes.

Bill Plumridge, manager of the Eastbourne Arndale Centre, said: “We’re really pleased to be involved in the Carnival for the fourth year running. This is a real highlight in Eastbourne’s calendar of events and has just got better and better since it began again in 2011. I’m delighted we’re celebrating our Queen’s 90th birthday as the Carnival theme and we were very pleased to welcome our own Pearly Queen to launch this year’s event.”

Stephen Lloyd, President of the Eastbourne Sunshine Carnival, said: ""I am absolutely delighted Legal & General has agreed, yet again, to step up and support our wonderful Sunshine Carnival. The event is now in its 5th year and L&G have been with us almost from the very beginning! I know it’s going to be another fantastic event with many thousands of local people either taking part or coming along to watch. When I was Eastbourne’s MP I was absolutely determined to bring the Sunshine Carnival back after it had stopped fifteen years before, and with the support of the superb Carnival Committee, all our brilliant volunteer Marshalls, the sponsors Legal & General, the Carnival participants and, most importantly, you, local residents, who have taken the event to its heart, it continues to grow successfully. Thank you all for stepping up and see you on Saturday the 11th of June.”

Anyone who would like to enter the event, or volunteer to be a steward should visit www.eastbournecarnival.co.uk

Folks. We could do with more volunteers to help steward so if you think you can help, please go to the website. Equally - if you want to enter a Float or a Walking Procession, details are on the website above., pronunciation=Dear All - Bit of good news for a change!

1632026600406302_1729886237287004,"Translated(src=en, dest=en, text=Dear All - my take on the new leadership appointments at our DGH. 

All change at the DGH:
 
After a long leadership hiatus with the NHS trust (ESHT), which runs our district general hospital, we finally have in place a new Chairman, David Clayton-Smith and Chief Executive, Dr Adrian Bull. Both men have impressive CV’s.
 
Dr Bull lives locally and was in the past Medical Director for Eastbourne and County NHS Trust, which subsequently became ESHT, so he should be more aware of the challenges our hospital faces, including our dreadful transport links with Hastings.
 
I’m one of nature’s natural optimists, so am hoping the new top team will make a genuinely positive difference to all of us, as prospective patients of the DGH (and of the community health services), as well as the long-suffering staff who went through the mill under the leadership of Darren Grayson and Stuart Welling. I still remember the regular letters from Welling accusing me of scare-mongering when, as the MP, I would go public with stories of shocking staff bullying which the CQC Report subsequently found to be true. 
 
So where are we at? I am convinced the various strategic bodies who oversee Hospital Trusts such as the TDA (Trust Development Authority) and particularly the Department of Health simply do not understand the unique difficulties presented to residents because of our shocking local road network, and the even worse public transport links, between Eastbourne and the Conquest Hospital in Hastings. If they did, they might not have disregarded the problems we've been flagging to them for the last ten years!
 
The SavetheDGH campaign team continue to meet regularly under the tremendous leadership of Liz Walke and I’ve remained an active member of the team. Having been involved for almost a decade, it made sense to stay involved, not least as living in Eastbourne I’ve a vested interest in trying to make our hospital work. We had a productive meeting with the new Improvement Director a few weeks ago, which bodes well for the future, and we’ll be meeting the new CEO and Chairman soon.
 
If I could give just three bits of advice to the new senior hospital managers they would be:
First - listen to local people and your staff. We really do know what works in Eastbourne and what doesn’t. 
 
Secondly - work ‘with’ the SavetheDGH team and not against: We are a cross party group with support from across the whole town. We also have experienced medical advisers on our committee so we only ask for what we believe are the right things clinically. 
 
And finally - bring back core services to the DGH or find ways to enhance services locally:
The shocking road between the two hospitals along with the lamentable public transport cannot be magically fixed, so allowing long and sometimes frightening trips for over a thousand expectant Eastbourne mums (and their families) every year to the Conquest simply cannot be allowed to continue. 
 
Adrian & David, I wish you all the best in your new posts and I look forward to helping you give Eastbourne and the surrounding area the hospital it deserves., pronunciation=Dear All - my take on the new leadership appointments at our DGH.

Hopefully IDS's resignation will mean the Treasury will do a u-turn on these PIP cuts. It's certainly now turned very fluid. 

I don't believe for a moment though, that that's why he's resigned. Otherwise his shocking 30% cuts to benefits for disabled people trying to find work that we've all been battling on over the last week or so would never have seen the light of day - and they've his fingerprints all over them!! Lord Freud who pushed them through the Lords is very close to IDS. I remember him well!

His resignation is really all about IDS absolute determination Brexit wins the EU referendum , and he's decided a strong card to play is to stuff Osborne very publicly over the benefits issue.

Why? Because the Chancellor is very much a 'remain' in the EU referendum (as I am but that's another story)  so by IDS resigning ""on principle"" he hopes to cause maximum political damage to the Chancellor, and thereby undermine a key advocate of the Remain case. 

And for IDS - an added bonus is that in Westminster we've all known for years that he loathed, as he saw, being constantly patronised by Osborne who was, apparently, pretty open in expressing a view that he thought IDS was a 'bit thick'. So to try to demolish Osborne very publicly at this critical stage of the referendum would also be in his view I suspect - payback time!! 

Charming bunch, some of the Tories at the mo. They appear to loath each other almost as much as the majority of Lab MP's appear to loath Jeremy Corbyn.......

Meanwhile - in the 'real' world - lets now have a u-turn on the almost 30% cuts to disability benefits from next year for those disabled people trying to find work. Whatever the somewhat bonkers machinations taking  place in parliament at the minute, this is both a wicked and a stupid proposal. Cutting such a huge chunk from a disabled persons income whilst they are trying to find a job is incredibly de-motivating! 

So do the right thing now George, even if your house does appear to be collapsing around your shoulders.

Hopefully enough other Tory MP's will now rebel to force Osborne into re-thinking his disgraceful plans announced in the budget to slash over a billion pounds from some disabled people's benefits.

Will our own MP Mrs Ansell join her colleague Dr Wollaston in doing the right thing I wonder?

Dear All

I've had sent to me a copy of Mrs Ansell's recent e-newsletter where she tries to defend her disgraceful vote to cut disabled people's income by almost a third. 

She says: ""I wanted to clarify some of the misinformation that has been circulating about a recent vote on disability benefit"" and then she goes onto repeat exactly the same government stance. 

What utter mealy-mouthed nonsense. 

Just to clarify the governments decision: From April next year  - all disabled people going onto Work Related ESA  WILL have almost a third of their weekly income cut.

Existing claimants will not be affected  - until, that is, they are reassessed!!!

ie: when their re-assessment comes up after April 2017 they will, as normal, put in a new claim for Work Related ESA but as a 'new' claimant will obviously be subject to the swingeing reduction in their income. That's the way the system works. Does Mrs Ansell think disabled people and their supporters in Eastbourne are so dim they don't know how the process pans out???

And this is supposed to 'encourage' disabled people to find work? I don't think so.

I also note the MP put in her latest e-newsletter why she voted against Sunday Trading. 

Now I knew the guy who led the backbench Tory opposition to the gov's attempts to extend Sunday Trading; its David Burrows MP. He has often emphasised his very deeply held Christian beliefs, which is why he is against extending Sunday trading (I am as well as it happens, but more because I think the supermarkets will just abuse their staff)

His strong Christian beliefs are shared by Mrs Ansell who writes about them and how much they mean to her as a politician. 

I respect that.

However, from a Christian perspective I'd just like to ask them both a hypothetical question: 'if Jesus were 'forced' to choose between slashing vulnerable, disabled people's income by almost 30% or to, regretfully, allow more shopping on a Sunday, which scenario do you think he'd believe was the lesser of two evils?

Which option - Caroline & David - do you think would cause less pain, less fear and hurt to your fellow human being?

Only asking......


So folks, If you agree with me (and many others) that Mrs Ansells decision along with her conservative colleagues was an absolutely deplorable act, then do please sign the petition below. It may force this ghastly bunch to do a u-turn and stop in its tracks a vicious attack on disabled people who are already trying their level best to get into employment. 

Thank you,


Petition: Reverse the ESA disability benefit cut
The House of Lords has been unable to stop a planned £30-a-week cut to disability benefits forced through by Government MPs. This will cripple those in receipt of these benefits, leaving many in literal poverty. The government must reverse this decision. Lives are at risk.

First off, thanks to everyone who took part in the survey. It's obviously only a snapshot from my 'own' Facebook Page but gives some idea of where things could be at the minute in Eastbourne. 

I plan to conduct and publish another one in a months time and every four weeks up to just before the referendum vote, to see if there are any discernible changes in the direction of travel. 

SL Facebook Survey 1:
Responses - 137
Vote to remain in the EU - 59.56%
Vote to leave the EU - 40.44%

The views most of you wrote supporting your positions were also noted. Immigration is clearly a major concern for many who say they'll vote to leave (though not exclusively; sovereignty was another) - whilst the economy/trade and the UK's internationalism/place in the world were particularly important for many of those who wish to stay. 

Meanwhile - elements from within both the different camps are beginning to shout at each other very loudly indeed which I don't find terribly helpful, and suspect I'm not alone in that. I doubt whether the volume is about to drop any time soon either, as it appears their is a fight to the death taking place within the Conservative Party at the minute over the issue. Extraordinary scenes of one cabinet minister furiously attacking another, and the PM, all in the mix.

Consequently, whilst remaining wholly upfront that I believe we 'are' better off remaining in the EU, I promise to continue posting my thoughts on the key issues as clearly as possible. A lot of people have yet to make up their mind so hopefully what I write will be of some constructive use.

Because it really is an important decision and it would be nice whatever conclusion Eastbourne (and further afield) comes to, it's made on rational, accurate and well thought out appraisal - either way!

Or - we could all end up supporting someone like Donald Trump.......

Dear All - it seems the starting gun has just fired on the EU Referendum! 

I suspect it will be a pretty complicated campaign, and I've been asked by a number of people what my views are. 

In a nutshell to me it's about trade and in straightforward terms the EU is far and away our largest trading partner - 48% - which is hugely significant. I believe such a substantial percentage of our business being with the EU makes it imperative we remain at the top table in Europe. 

Bluntly if we're 'in' we can influence the EU's direction better than if we vote to leave. I think that's a pretty fair conclusion.

There will be a lot of hyperbole over the next few months and, frankly, I expect both sides will exaggerate the benefits and the negatives - but on balance my quiet view is we as a nation are stronger and more prosperous being 'part' of the worlds richest trading bloc.

On a personal note I also have an instinctive sense that if we voted to leave, the UK would become a more introvert, inward looking country and that's not something I feel would be good for our long-term future.

My advice to my FB friends though is listen to all the arguments carefully and then take a considered view. It's a vital decision and your vote, when the time comes, will be genuinely important.

One of the charity's I was always very supportive of is called Eastbourne & Wealden Young Enterprise. It's actually a national initiative but has had a very strong local group for a few years, headed up by the splendid Gordon and Mary Piggott. 

The principle is very simple: working with local schools they encourage and support our young people to set up a proper small company so that they can learn how to run a business. 

I think it's a brilliant idea as it helps our young people learn with proper hands-on experience what it takes. When I was your MP it was always one of my favourite activities - to meet the students, quiz them on whatever products they were selling, watch them learn what worked and what didn't, and then see with my own eyes the spark of enterprise and business be lit in many of those taking part.

And who knows - maybe over the last few years I've met a future Richard Branson without knowing it!!

Anyway - this Saturday (6th Feb) they are conducting their annual trade fair at the Arndale Centre (thx again to Bill and Jeanette for being such great supporters) so do pop along, see what's on offer and if you see something you like - buy it! 

In my opinion it's not only a 'good' thing to support but the youngsters always have some fun, relevant products for sale. 
 
See below their FB group event page. 
https://www.facebook.com/events/184972875191989/

One of the charity's I was always very supportive of is called Eastbourne & Wealden Young Enterprise. It's actually a national initiative but has had a very strong local group for a few years, headed up by the splendid Gordon and Mary Piggott. 

The principle is very simple: working with local schools they encourage and support our young people to set up a proper small company so that they can learn how to run a business. 

I think it's a brilliant idea as it helps our young people learn with proper hands-on experience what it takes. When I was your MP it was always one of my favourite activities - to meet the students, quiz them on whatever products they were selling, watch them learn what worked and what didn't, and then see with my own eyes the spark of enterprise and business be lit in many of those taking part.

And who knows - maybe over the last few years I've met a future Richard Branson without knowing it!!

Anyway - this Saturday (6th Feb) they are conducting their annual trade fair at the Arndale Centre (thx again to Bill and Jeanette for being such great supporters) so do pop along, see what's on offer and if you see something you like - buy it! 

In my opinion it's not only a 'good' thing to support but the youngsters always have some fun, relevant products for sale.

In 2010 the Coalition Government set out to simplify the complex benefits system and change it to make sure that no one was worse off when they went to work. The fundamental principle was to ensure those in low incomes were better off in a job than being on benefits.

To do that we agreed to introduce Universal Credit, which in its original form would have reduced poverty and made 3 million working people better off.

Yet it soon became obvious that George Osborne and the Treasury saw the introduction of Universal Credit not as a way of improving the benefits system, but as an excuse to cut benefits instead of helping families out of poverty.

I was always clear, along with  my colleagues in parliament, that the shift to Universal Credit 'must not' be done on the cheap – otherwise the very people we want to help would be hurt. 

Now, without us to stop them, the Tories look set to get their way. So we’re campaigning yet again to make sure those on Universal Credit aren’t worse off.

George Osborne’s changes will mean millions of low-income people in work will be worse off. People affected could lose more than £1,000 per year. And the incentive to work - which was the main point of UC - will be significantly reduced. 

Similar to their proposed tax credit changes which were eventually blocked in the House of Lords, the Conservative Government clearly hopes that their cuts to UC are sufficiently complicated so that no one will notice. 

I think this is utterly wrong.

Which is why I am supporting the Lib Dem fight to retain the objective started in 2010 to lift families out of poverty, reduce the complexity of the benefits system and increase the incentive to work - but I need your help. Please click on the link below to support our campaign:

Dear All – one of our biggest mistakes during the last parliamentary term was to renege on the promise on tuition fees. No if’s nor but’s - it was a disaster for the Lib Dems, and I never hid away from that or tried to deny it. We got it howlingly wrong and my god we paid the price! 
 
Which is why at the time despite coming under tremendous pressure from the Whips I flatly refused to toe the party line and voted instead 'against' a rise in university tuition fees.
 
I am reminding you of this episode not because I’m a masochist but because, despite everything, when we ran the relevant government department in the coalition (Vince Cable was the sec of state) we also took stringent efforts to ‘protect’ those from the poorest background, so that they would still be able to afford to attend university. 
 
We introduced something called the graduate maintenance grant, which is a top-up of almost £3,400pa specifically geared toward young students from low income backgrounds, enabling them to have the confidence to know they could afford digs and such like, even if they could not rely on the bank of mum and dad.

This protection was something I was proud of as a truly positive and egalitarian policy by the Liberal Democrats in government, despite the challenges of the economic recession. And it has been hugely successful - with currently around 500,000 students from very low income families attending university; more than ever before - and a fair number from our own Eastbourne.
 
A good move, a fair move and one which I looked forward to seeing carrying on even though we were no longer in the government.
 
Wrong.
 
The Tories have just abolished this crucial scheme and replaced it with a facility - wait for this - to ‘allow’ you to borrow even ‘more’ money if you are from a poorer background. 
 
This is profoundly disappointing and it takes George Osborne ‘not’ to understand  that if you are poor the fear of debt is magnified tenfold compared to if you are wealthy. Exactly why we introduced the maintenance grant in the first place; so kids from backgrounds that weren't flush with cash would NOT be put off going to university.
 
Yesterday in parliament was a travesty. There was an opposition day debate where the government was urged to scrap their decision to abolish the maintenance grant. 

It lost by only 292 votes against 306. The narrowest of margins!
 
Our own MP Mrs Ansell voted ‘for’ the government so graduate maintenance grants for poorer kids across Eastbourne and beyond who want to go to university – probably for the first time ever in their family - will now be cut to shreds. 
 
Folks. The last few months has shown locally clearer than even I would ever have imagined - we got what we voted for.....
  
Shame on those MP’s.

The Academy serves an area where there are a lot of good folk who are not terribly well off - but they want the best for their kids, so does the school and so do I.
 
There were a lot of hardworking youngsters in this photo – who should they choose to go to uni next year - will no longer receive the graduate maintenance grant.

Yesterday (Wed) in parliament there was a vote to allow shale-gas fracking to take place underneath National Park land and disappointingly the government won, though by only 37 votes. This legislation runs wholly counter to what the Coalition Government did when the issue was last debated in January – where I voted against fracking overall - but ministers 'did' give a pledge that there would be an “outright ban” on fracking within National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Beauty. 
 
However, now the Lib Dem ministers are no longer part of the government the pledge has simply been dumped by the Conservatives!
 
I am profoundly annoyed by this. It is appalling to contemplate that fracking can now potentially take place under our very own South Downs National Park. Such a beautiful iconic area is central to Eastbourne’s history. I’d even go so far as to say it's part of who we are as a Town. 

For the Tories to pass a Bill that could allow the extraction of shale gas from the South Downs is nothing less than a desecration and must never be allowed to happen. And for our own MP, Mrs Ansell, to vote to support this dreadful legislation is profoundly unsatisfactory to say the least.
 
To be honest the vote yesterday in Westminster has set me pondering over a few of our differences recently on national issues. Such as her voting to cut Working Tax Credit for low income working families, her support for the UK joining in the bombing of Syria – without in my opinion a coherent plan, objectives or re-construction strategy - her quiet acceptance of a £7,000 salary hike whilst all the public sector workers such as nurses and teachers were getting either zero or one percent. And now this – to vote in support of fracking for shale gas under our National Parks and Places of Outstanding Beauty is just plain wrong.
 
However I guess it hasn’t taken long for folk to see the difference between what I would have done nationally - and the new MP.
 
As for contrasting any differences locally between what was my level of activity and accessibility as your MP, and Mrs Ansell?

Banned from entering the U.S. end of.

My first inclination to be honest was just to disregard the man as a blowhard; a man who will say and do anything to get attention in his bid to be the Republican candidate in next years US Presidential elections. To ignore the palpable nonsense of his statement: it's like saying that as a right wing Christian fundamentalist murdered the people at the family planning clinic in the States only a couple of weeks ago this means 'all' Christians are murderers. Clearly a view we know to be both absurd and profoundly insulting.

But that is exactly what Trump is saying, albeit about a different faith, with his latest statement about Muslims - none can be trusted because they're 'all' potentially bad.....

Surely therefore everyone can see through the utter stupidity of what this buffoon is saying. Surely?

And yet, and yet. You see, what Donald Trump does so effectively is sprout what I call 'Truthisms' A non-word to be honest but it means something that is factually totally 'wrong' but just  'feels' right - to some. 

And to illustrate how incredibly wrong Trump is with his facts in this instance, never mind the sheer immorality of his statement; from what direction do you think America faces its greatest threat to its own citizens?

Well since the atrocity of 9/11 perpetuated by those murderous thugs otherwise know as Al-Queda, 57 American citizens have died in the U.S. as a result of Muslim linked terrorism - as against 190,000 who have died from 'normal' - if one can call it such - gun crime.

Yes. You read that right - 190,000 people have died (2014 study by North  Carolina university) through gun crimes in the great U.S. of A over the same period. 

This is an appalling carnage on an industrial scale. 

But rather than address a real, daily and present threat, the fear that Trump is tapping into so assiduously is the oldest canard of all, the fear of the 'other', the fear from ALL Muslims not just the jihadists. And as can be seen from his latest poll showing - he leads by a long way the other Republican candidates - his approach appears to be working to his advantage.

Logically you'd think he would be advocating steps to stop the terrible and tragic 190,000 massacre amongst his own people but of course he won't, because gun control in the States is seen a a 'liberal' issue, promulgated by namby-pamby Americans like President Obama......

And such a move would be anathema to the angry hard right-wing core base he's targeting because you see, they just 'know' he's right - it's 'their' Truthism.

Consequently, Trump talks up the threat, stokes the fear and keeps gurning at the TV cameras day in day out on the campaign trail to wild applause, and all we can do is sit on the sidelines feeling hopeless and helpless at the sheer wickedness of what he is saying, and being applauded - in the most powerful nation on earth!

And we pray to whoever is our respective God or belief that the American voters will see through this demagogue. See through the madness and consign him to the outer reaches of U.S. shock-jock talk radio shows where every day it seems, the hosts scream and howl at the malevolent shadows they imagine surrounding them.

I have no problem, in principle, of totally destroying ISIS/Daesh. An utterly murderous group whose purpose includes killing anyone who doesn't fit their particular brand of jihadist terrorism. However, I believe the one central question that has to be answered is 'what's the long term plan' and as this has most definitely not been made clear, simply bombing for the sake of it is precipitous and likely counter-productive.

With no clear realistic objective or even a road-map toward a clear objective.

This is why I found the Conservatives approach to the whole tax credit farrago so illuminating. It shone a light on who they are and what they aim to do.  And to me it was not elevating!

Because what was really deplorable about Osborne is he would have known the OBR (Office of Budget Responsibility - the independent body who predict future tax revenue & economic growth)  had found this £23m (not the £27m I wrote by mistake yesterday) down the back of the sofa and yet 'still' he tried to introduce the cut to working tax credits despite that knowledge.

Because what was really deplorable about Osborne is he would have known the OBR (Office of Budget Responsibility - the independent body who predict future tax revenue & economic growth)  had found this £23m (not the £27m I wrote by mistake yesterday) down the back of the sofa and yet 'still' he tried to introduce the cut to working tax credits despite that knowledge. 

And with the support of the vast majority of Tory MP's! 

If it hadn't been for the Lords he would have gone ahead purely for idealogical reasons, knowing full well it wasn't necessary. That's why I believe it was a vicious and deliberate  attack on the working poor, and that is what was so wrong. And that is what Mrs Ansell supported along with her colleagues. Not right, not good, not fair.

So yes, I am glad he did a u-turn but their original intent was disgraceful and I for one won't forget what the Tories planned to do.)",

I always thought it made sense to introduce first-aid training in schools. Our excellent St John's in Eastbourne have mentioned this to me a few times, so I was disappointed the private members bill introduced yesterday in parliament was talked out. 

This means that if some MP's stand up and keep talking - literally, and what they say can bear little resemblance to the bill - the proposal 'runs out of time'. Meaning it cannot go to a second reading.

And I see that Philip Davies spoke the longest! I remember him well. He loathed the liberals in Westminster because we stopped the really vicious ideas emanating from the Tories when we were in coalition - such as firing staff without due cause - and he's talked out a number of bills recently. Including a law to make 'homes fit for human habitation' & free hospital parking for carers. Nice man.....?

Stopping the first-aid proposal from progressing is very typical of him. I think he's wrong as some basic first aid training to all our children at the right age could, genuinely, save lives, many lives over a period of time.

I also noted the proposal was backed by St John Ambulance, the British Red Cross, and the British Heart Foundation. I'm pretty sure they know what they are talking about over this issue.

Ever since I first read those harrowing words over forty years ago when I was still at school, (written by a German Lutheran Pastor who was imprisoned by the Nazis in Dachau concentration camp), I just instinctively knew a key thread for a functioning, secure democratic nation HAD to be the rights of individuals 'not' to be persecuted for their beliefs by the State. 

I also grasped that for this to work for 'all' of us, then some pretty unpleasant individuals rights would need protecting as well.

This is why I remain, all these years later, so strongly of the view the Human Rights Act MUST be retained. 

I appreciate there are many in the Conservative and UKIP Party's who disagree. And I respect their different view.

All I'd ask is - to what end? 

The Act enshrines into law - even above the State - certain specific rights and freedoms. 

Something I am convinced that without, the poems bleak message above may once again turn out to be prophetic.

Take a look at the animation below on the Act and exactly what it protects. I appreciate its done in a rather simple, cheesy manner but I think encapsulates brilliantly, in only two minutes, why we would be heading down a dangerous path if the UK ever got rid of the Human Right Act, as some are calling for.

Dear All

Many of you in the comments section  of my FB post (below), which I posted a few days ago informing Eastbourne and beyond that the Chairman of the DGH - Stuart Welling - had finally done the right thing and resigned, have very kindly been urging I put myself forward to be the new Chairman of our hospital and community trust - ESHT.

I am genuinely touched by your belief and support for me. Thank you.

However, I profoundly believe the new Chair of our DGH / NHS Trust, whoever it is, 'must' have a deep and serious understanding of exactly how the health service works. 

The reasons for this are very straightforward.  

They're are simply far too many complexities and, frankly, opportunities for some to blindside an individual who lacked an in-depth knowledge of the NHS generally and our own hospital/community NHS in particular, so I am convinced we need someone who would know 'exactly' which levers to pull.

In other words to really turn our hospital around I believe we need someone with the following strengths: 

- they must have an excellent understanding of just how the NHS really works.
- they must be passionately committed to Eastbourne and our local hospital / Community Health Services.
- they must have a broad knowledge of clinical best practice 
- they must understand how the different and often myriad processes function within our £350m per annum and 7,000 employee NHS Trust. 
- And finally, they must genuinely want to work 'with' the local community and not 'against' - as appeared so often to be the case under the previous CEO and Chairman.

Now I know this list seems a tall order but I want to put a name out there. 

He is someone I got to know well and respected a great deal when I was your MP. And also like, for that matter!

His name is Dr Peter Nash. 

A thoroughly qualified individual who for the last ten years or so has been the successful Chair of that wonderful community group - The Friends of Eastbourne DGH.

Prior to this Peter was a consultant anaesthetist at the DGH as well as being the Trusts Medical Director in its heyday. 

I know he'd be the first to stress he was actually looking forward to a few years of taking it easy, but I also know he is passionate about our town and for our hospital to have a secure future.

If asked by the department of health I am sure he will step up. Even if it's just for two years to get the good ship DGH sailing confidently in the right direction. 

I hope the powers-that-be recognise the value of my proposal and contact him. 

Well folks - that's my suggestion and the reasons why. If I believed I could do the job competently on your and the town's behalf I promise you that wild horses wouldn't keep me away.

However, I am strongly of the view that elements of this proposed Bill are genuinely wrong and potentially dangerous for 'all' our civil liberties. 

For instance, if passed it would:

- 'criminalise' unions if members fail to wear armbands on lawful pickets.
- criminalise lawful picketers if when taking part they fail to give their names and addresses to the police 
- and criminalise the unions if they breach new social media laws around proposed strikes.

Ehhhh!! What on earth is going on here?

You may think - so what? Or you may take one look at the far left, class-based nonsense sprouted by some of the big union leaders such as Len McCluskey and again say - so what?

Well - there's plenty 'so what' Look again at just the three elements from the Bill I've outlined above.

Imagine how this would affect people, ordinary people; your neighbours, friends, colleagues even you or I simply standing up, legally I might add, for what they/we believe is right - and all this after having taken a lawful vote to strike?

And tell me this isn't a very dangerous, slippery slope the conservative government appears to be prepared to tread?

In my opinion it's a bad, even bonkers piece of legislation that is ideologically driven from the hard right-wing within the Tory Party. Aimed not at enhancing cooperation between employers and employees but instead attempting to deliver an absolute hammer blow against the trade union movement in this country. 

And folks you know my position on Jeremy Corbyn and the far left, and you know I am as passionately pro-business as I am pro-equal opportunity and I'm telling you straight: There are parts of this Bill which are NOT enlightened progress but instead could lead to the stifling of reasonable, democratic dissent and, frankly, it's not the way we do things in this county. 

To use an old fashioned but often sound phrase - it's simply not British!

And it's a future I oppose, TOTALLY.   

Grrrrrr........, pronunciation=POLITICS BUT IMPORTANT!!

Saturday week (19th September), we are having a Book and Bake sale to raise funds for the Old Town Community Library. Please do come along and support this fantastic local library. For those of you who don't know, OT residents fought a real battle ten years ago or so against the County Council who unilaterally tried to close the service. The campaign was led by that wonderful old liberal Councillor, Maurice Skilton. He worked tirelessly with local residents and our brilliant librarian Pam to keep the library open. I was delighted to be involved from the beginning and even more delighted when we secured funds from the Borough Council and a number of other grant making bodies to keep Old Town's Community Library open. 

It's been running now for over 10 years, led by Pam as our chief librarian, supported by Gina and many wonderful volunteers. However, as time has passed and numerous new families have moved into Old Town I doubt whether a lot of them actually know of the library's existence!    So we are having this fun book and bake sale day on Saturday week; 10.30 to 3pm to remind people just how important libraries are to the community; to raise some much needed funds for our Library and also, hopefully, attract new volunteers to ensure this wonderful community victory against the dreadful original decision by ESCC stays serving Old Town for many years to come. 

Please do come along and support this fun event, and your local library. There will be loads of second hand books for sale, I've persuaded heaps of tremendous people to bake a wide range of wonderful cakes, and your Old Town Councillors will be running, what I'm informed will be an outstanding tombola!! 

Unsurprisingly, I will be hovering around the cake stall.......

I've posted my e-newsletter which went out a couple of days ago. Sorry it makes for such a long post but for those who are my FB friends but not on my e-newsletter list and would like to read it - please see below. Rgds, SL 

'As I flagged in my last e-newsletter I will continue doing a regular email covering a little of what I am doing locally, along with a few thoughts on some of the key national issues from time to time.  This month I am focusing on national issues, as I'm drawn by what's going on with the two main Parties at the minute. The Tory's in majority government and the Labour Party's apparent determination to elect Jeremy Corbyn as their new Leader.
 
Lets look at the Conservatives first: if they say a week is a long time in politics, then the last couple of months seem to have seen the Tories move very firmly to the right on the political spectrum. With Labour turning in on itself and the Lib Dems, sadly in my view currently diminished, I do wonder who will hold this government seriously and intelligently to account.

I was particularly struck with this thought recently, when I read a comment from a Government Minister, Matthew Hancock. Now I knew Matthew and worked with him on a couple of apprenticeship initiatives when we were both in the Coalition, and he was the apprenticeship minister under Vince Cable at Biz.
 
He struck me then as a sensible politician, who had some understanding of the challenges people from more under-privileged backgrounds experience. And yet - in his new role as Minister for the Cabinet Office - he was quoted as saying that to break the underperforming cycle of some young people, he was introducing what he called a 'boot camp' and a 'no excuses' culture. 

I found this profoundly depressing to read. Such a pure Daily Mail approach to young people has been tried numerous times by Conservatives, of various stripes, over the years and - guess what - its never worked. We are dealing with a group that has been historically under-achieving and, consequently, have a deep seated low sense of self worth and low confidence. How anyone in their right mind thinks putting such individuals through a 'boot camp' regime will work is simply beyond me.

And I know what I'm talking about: a jobs initiative I implemented in Eastbourne as the MP in partnership with our local Job Centre last year, aimed at people who were long term unemployed, achieved a 30% success rate in securing local residents employment. This compares very favourably with the gov's Work Programme for the same cohort of people which secured employment, on average, for only 4.2% of participants!!

How did we do it? We focused 'positively' on the individuals, we emphasised it was a partnership between us, the employers and the long-term unemployed participants - and it worked, as the figures showed. I profoundly believe that optimism, respect, trust along with strong boundaries and encouragement, all secure a much better response from people than threats or insults.

How is it then that a Minister who I believed grasped these fundamental points has moved so far to the right so quickly? I think its tokenistic politics; irrational thinking based on ideology rather than objective analysis on what actually works, and worst of all - leads to unsuccessful outcomes, only serving to demoralise disadvantaged young people even more.
 
Which leads me to the Labour Party leadership battle and Jeremy Corbyn, who it seems clear is very likely to be their new Leader in a few days time. I've watched this with great interest not least as the Labour establishments frantic efforts to stop him winning are clearly having the opposite effect. 

My prediction is - he'll win. There will be a honeymoon period - a short honeymoon - and then the Party will implode into a bitter public fight which will cause it terrible damage long into the future. And for the record, this does not bring me a jot of satisfaction as I do not believe a Conservative Party unchecked is good for the overall health of UKplc. 

Of course this could present an opportunity for a centrist, moderate Party which is as pro-business as it is equal opportunity. 

A political party that is rationally rather than fundamentally green, that sets a high score on individual liberty against an over-mighty state, a party that prioritises education for people from disadvantaged backgrounds because it recognises it as the silver bullet for creating opportunities in employment. A party that is internationalist in outlook and optimistic about human potential, a party that kept the nastier elements of conservatism in check. 

And guess what, we already have one - the Liberal Democrats!
 
All the best folks. Its interesting times ahead..........

1632026600406302_1642903035985325,"Translated(src=en, dest=en, text=Dear All - this week was the anniversary of last years dreadful fire on our beloved Pier. I did a piece for bbc se as they were going over the whole event, and providing an update. See the link here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-33808185

I was enormously proud of the way our whole town rallied around this time last year. Initially the media wanted to turn us into victims but Eastbourne wasn't having any of that!! 

The Leader of the council David Tutt and I must have made twenty+ media interviews each over the difficult first few hours and we were absolutely joined at the hip in what we were saying: ""yes this is a tragedy for the Pier and for our town but no we are not going to roll over and become victims. The whole of Eastbourne  would rally around to support the pier and those affected; we would use this tragedy positively because that's the way we do things in Eastbourne.""

And you know what - gradually, painfully, we got the broadcast media to turn their usual 'tragic - we're  all doomed narrative' to change. It was bloody hard work mind you, but I knew the local community, you guys, got it and would respond.  

Now a year later you'll have heard the Pier is up for sale. I'd picked up talk of this actually for quite some time now, and I was well aware the owners had already sold a couple of other piers they owned. The key thing for me tho, and I believe for Eastbourne, is we continue to work closely and positively with whoever the new owners are. And continue to support what frankly is now probably one of the best known piers in the world!

On that note to be honest I was disappointed the temporary fairground rides didn't work out, and if I'd still been the MP I would have actively supported the idea. I think it could have been fun, attracted a lot of extra footfall to the seafront and Pier and generally been an added attraction for Eastbourne this summer. However, we are where we are, so my advice to the pier owners is don't give up. Why not have  a couple of community/family fun days on the repaired platforms through this Aug and Sept?  Go and book a few face painters, ice cream sellers (Fuchiardi's is only a few yards away, after all), jugglers, kids ballon-artists, local charity tombolla stalls etc; all with a fun jazz or pop band and - hay presto - the people will come! Just a thought......

Have a good weekend folks, SL, pronunciation=Dear All - this week was the anniversary of last years dreadful fire on our beloved Pier. I did a piece for bbc se as they were going over the whole event, and providing an update. See the link here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-33808185

I was enormously proud of the way our whole town rallied around this time last year. Initially the media wanted to turn us into victims but Eastbourne wasn't having any of that!! 

The Leader of the council David Tutt and I must have made twenty+ media interviews each over the difficult first few hours and we were absolutely joined at the hip in what we were saying: ""yes this is a tragedy for the Pier and for our town but no we are not going to roll over and become victims. The whole of Eastbourne  would rally around to support the pier and those affected; we would use this tragedy positively because that's the way we do things in Eastbourne.""

And you know what - gradually, painfully, we got the broadcast media to turn their usual 'tragic - we're  all doomed narrative' to change. It was bloody hard work mind you, but I knew the local community, you guys, got it and would respond.  

Now a year later you'll have heard the Pier is up for sale. I'd picked up talk of this actually for quite some time now, and I was well aware the owners had already sold a couple of other piers they owned. The key thing for me tho, and I believe for Eastbourne, is we continue to work closely and positively with whoever the new owners are. And continue to support what frankly is now probably one of the best known piers in the world!

About time frankly! I've been calling for him to go for almost two years. How he had the nerve to stay on after the Care Quality Commission (CQC) labelled the Leadership at the Trust as 'inadequate' is beyond me!! 

Anyway - some of you will know that I have also being calling for the Chairman of our hospital trust to resign as well. Stuart Welling. He is just as culpable as Grayson. He hired him and he stood shoulder to shoulder with the CEO denying everything Liz WALKE and the Savethedgh campaign team had been saying for ages. As your MP whenever I went public with allegations of bullying or questioning his and Grayson's dreadful leadership, Mr Welling would write and accuse me of scaremongering. His letters escalated in their fury!

Well - after the CQC Report came out we all knew we were right and he was wrong. 

But - and this is hard to believe -  Stuart Welling has had his contract as Chair extended by a year to help the handover process and to maintain stability. This is completely bonkers and I said so when I attended a meeting with the NHS TDA.

In my judgement Welling is part of the 'problem' not the solution. I have real anxieties this is part of a stitch up by the dept of health: Welling stays, a Grayson doppelgänger is appointed, the same Board that failed so spectacularly according to the CQC stays on, and our poor old DGH and local community services and their dedicated but extremely long-suffering staff have to keep picking up the pieces. Surely this cannot be right?

Liz hit the nail on the head when I saw her on BBC SE last week saying that not only should Welling go but the people of Eastbourne deserve an apology for their lamentable leadership. Spot on as ever - and we are all still waiting for a response.....

So: I am posting this to ask if you would take the time to sign the petition below another one of our savethedgh team have put together - Thx Selene - demanding the Chairman and the Board also resign. How can we honestly expect them to turn around a hospital that they themselves have made such a hash of running?

In my opinion it's time for a complete change at the top, and for the Dept of Health to take some responsibility to sort it out. Eastbourne deserves a first class hospital and we need the decent quality leadership that is actually capable of providing this. Rgds, SL

It is our duty to think of the future with this template. Because if the boys have to pay for this reform, then they have a right to it, that it is geared towards the long term.

Sound information and lively discussion characterized the FDP Network Briefing Sempach ""Pension Reform 2020 - What's good for business?"". Co-President Elmar Bernet welcomed the numerous visitors in the Festhalle Seepark to deepening their knowledge and forming opinions. The focus was on contributions by Councilor Damian Müller and REVOR collective foundation director Georg Dubach. Dedicated guests and experts discussed opportunities and limitations of the planned reform. The final Aperó was briskly used for networking.

My conclusion: The AHV expansion leads in the medium term to enormous pressure on pension age increase and additional financing! The AHV expansion was not a goal of the reform. The pension plan2020 is not sustainably funded, but ""fire accelerator"", which requires further measures from 2025. The present reform proposal is ""not a true Swiss compromise, but a dictate of a gossamer majority. It is part of the political game that the proponents threaten with reform backlog.
